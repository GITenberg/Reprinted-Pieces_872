<h2><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>THE
LONG VOYAGE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the wind is blowing and the
sleet or rain is driving against the dark windows, I love to sit
by the fire, thinking of what I have read in books of voyage and
travel.&nbsp; Such books have had a strong fascination for my
mind from my earliest childhood; and I wonder it should have come
to pass that I never have been round the world, never have been
shipwrecked, ice-environed, tomahawked, or eaten.</p>
<p>Sitting on my ruddy hearth in the twilight of New Year&rsquo;s
Eve, I find incidents of travel rise around me from all the
latitudes and longitudes of the globe.&nbsp; They observe no
order or sequence, but appear and vanish as they
will&mdash;&lsquo;come like shadows, so depart.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Columbus, alone upon the sea with his disaffected crew, looks
over the waste of waters from his high station on the poop of his
ship, and sees the first uncertain glimmer of the light,
&lsquo;rising and falling with the waves, like a torch in the
bark of some fisherman,&rsquo; which is the shining star of a new
world.&nbsp; Bruce is caged in Abyssinia, surrounded by the gory
horrors which shall often startle him out of his sleep at home
when years have passed away.&nbsp; Franklin, come to the end of
his unhappy overland journey&mdash;would that it had been his
last!&mdash;lies perishing of hunger with his brave companions:
each emaciated figure stretched upon its miserable bed without
the power to rise: all, dividing the weary days between their
prayers, their remembrances of the dear ones at home, and
conversation on the pleasures of eating; the last-named topic
being ever present to them, likewise, in their dreams.&nbsp; All
the African travellers, wayworn, solitary and sad, submit
themselves again to drunken, murderous, man-selling despots, of
the lowest order of humanity; and Mungo Park, fainting under a
tree and succoured by a woman, gratefully remembers how his Good
Samaritan has always come to him in woman&rsquo;s shape, the wide
world over.</p>
<p>A shadow on the wall in which my mind&rsquo;s eye can discern
some traces of a rocky sea-coast, recalls to me a fearful story
of travel derived from that unpromising narrator of such stories,
a parliamentary blue-book.&nbsp; A convict is its chief figure,
and this man escapes with other prisoners from a penal
settlement.&nbsp; It is an island, and they seize a boat, and get
to the main land.&nbsp; Their way is by a rugged and precipitous
sea-shore, and they have no earthly hope of ultimate escape, for
the party of soldiers despatched by an easier course to cut them
off, must inevitably arrive at their distant bourne long before
them, and retake them if by any hazard they survive the horrors
of the way.&nbsp; Famine, as they all must have foreseen, besets
them early in their course.&nbsp; Some of the party die and are
eaten; some are murdered by the rest and eaten.&nbsp; This one
awful creature eats his fill, and sustains his strength, and
lives on to be recaptured and taken back.&nbsp; The unrelateable
experiences through which he has passed have been so tremendous,
that he is not hanged as he might be, but goes back to his old
chained-gang work.&nbsp; A little time, and he tempts one other
prisoner away, seizes another boat, and flies once
more&mdash;necessarily in the old hopeless direction, for he can
take no other.&nbsp; He is soon cut off, and met by the pursuing
party face to face, upon the beach.&nbsp; He is alone.&nbsp; In
his former journey he acquired an inappeasable relish for his
dreadful food.&nbsp; He urged the new man away, expressly to kill
him and eat him.&nbsp; In the pockets on one side of his coarse
convict-dress, are portions of the man&rsquo;s body, on which he
is regaling; in the pockets on the other side is an untouched
store of salted pork (stolen before he left the island) for which
he has no appetite.&nbsp; He is taken back, and he is
hanged.&nbsp; But I shall never see that sea-beach on the wall or
in the fire, without him, solitary monster, eating as he prowls
along, while the sea rages and rises at him.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh (a worse man to be entrusted with arbitrary
power there could scarcely be) is handed over the side of the
Bounty, and turned adrift on the wide ocean in an open boat, by
order of Fletcher Christian, one of his officers, at this very
minute.&nbsp; Another flash of my fire, and &lsquo;Thursday
October Christian,&rsquo; five-and-twenty years of age, son of
the dead and gone Fletcher by a savage mother, leaps aboard His
Majesty&rsquo;s ship Briton, hove-to off Pitcairn&rsquo;s Island;
says his simple grace before eating, in good English; and knows
that a pretty little animal on board is called a dog, because in
his childhood he had heard of such strange creatures from his
father and the other mutineers, grown grey under the shade of the
bread-fruit trees, speaking of their lost country far away.</p>
<p>See the Halsewell, East Indiaman outward bound, driving madly
on a January night towards the rocks near Seacombe, on the island
of Purbeck!&nbsp; The captain&rsquo;s two dear daughters are
aboard, and five other ladies.&nbsp; The ship has been driving
many hours, has seven feet water in her hold, and her mainmast
has been cut away.&nbsp; The description of her loss, familiar to
me from my early boyhood, seems to be read aloud as she rushes to
her destiny.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;About two in the morning of Friday the
sixth of January, the ship still driving, and approaching very
fast to the shore, Mr. Henry Meriton, the second mate, went again
into the cuddy, where the captain then was.&nbsp; Another
conversation taking place, Captain Pierce expressed extreme
anxiety for the preservation of his beloved daughters, and
earnestly asked the officer if he could devise any method of
saving them.&nbsp; On his answering with great concern, that he
feared it would be impossible, but that their only chance would
be to wait for morning, the captain lifted up his hands in silent
and distressful ejaculation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this dreadful moment, the ship struck, with such
violence as to dash the heads of those standing in the cuddy
against the deck above them, and the shock was accompanied by a
shriek of horror that burst at one instant from every quarter of
the ship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many of the seamen, who had been remarkably inattentive
and remiss in their duty during great part of the storm, now
poured upon deck, where no exertions of the officers could keep
them, while their assistance might have been useful.&nbsp; They
had actually skulked in their hammocks, leaving the working of
the pumps and other necessary labours to the officers of the
ship, and the soldiers, who had made uncommon exertions.&nbsp;
Roused by a sense of their danger, the same seamen, at this
moment, in frantic exclamations, demanded of heaven and their
fellow-sufferers that succour which their own efforts, timely
made, might possibly have procured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ship continued to beat on the rocks; and soon
bilging, fell with her broadside towards the shore.&nbsp; When
she struck, a number of the men climbed up the ensign-staff,
under an apprehension of her immediately going to pieces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Meriton, at this crisis, offered to these unhappy
beings the best advice which could be given; he recommended that
all should come to the side of the ship lying lowest on the
rocks, and singly to take the opportunities which might then
offer, of escaping to the shore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having thus provided, to the utmost of his power, for
the safety of the desponding crew, he returned to the
round-house, where, by this time, all the passengers and most of
the officers had assembled.&nbsp; The latter were employed in
offering consolation to the unfortunate ladies; and, with
unparalleled magnanimity, suffering their compassion for the fair
and amiable companions of their misfortunes to prevail over the
sense of their own danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this charitable work of comfort, Mr. Meriton now
joined, by assurances of his opinion, that, the ship would hold
together till the morning, when all would be safe.&nbsp; Captain
Pierce, observing one of the young gentlemen loud in his
exclamations of terror, and frequently cry that the ship was
parting, cheerfully bid him be quiet, remarking that though the
ship should go to pieces, he would not, but would be safe
enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is difficult to convey a correct idea of the scene
of this deplorable catastrophe, without describing the place
where it happened.&nbsp; The Haleswell struck on the rocks at a
part of the shore where the cliff is of vast height, and rises
almost perpendicular from its base.&nbsp; But at this particular
spot, the foot of the cliff is excavated into a cavern of ten or
twelve yards in depth, and of breadth equal to the length of a
large ship.&nbsp; The sides of the cavern are so nearly upright,
as to be of extremely difficult access; and the bottom is strewed
with sharp and uneven rocks, which seem, by some convulsion of
the earth, to have been detached from its roof.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ship lay with her broadside opposite to the mouth
of this cavern, with her whole length stretched almost from side
to side of it.&nbsp; But when she struck, it was too dark for the
unfortunate persons on board to discover the real magnitude of
the danger, and the extreme horror of such a situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition to the company already in the round-house,
they had admitted three black women and two soldiers&rsquo;
wives; who, with the husband of one of them, had been allowed to
come in, though the seamen, who had tumultuously demanded
entrance to get the lights, had been opposed and kept out by Mr.
Rogers and Mr. Brimer, the third and fifth mates.&nbsp; The
numbers there were, therefore, now increased to near fifty.&nbsp;
Captain Pierce sat on a chair, a cot, or some other moveable,
with a daughter on each side, whom he alternately pressed to his
affectionate breast.&nbsp; The rest of the melancholy assembly
were seated on the deck, which was strewed with musical
instruments, and the wreck of furniture and other articles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here also Mr. Meriton, after having cut several
wax-candles in pieces, and stuck them up in various parts of the
round-house, and lighted up all the glass lanthorns he could
find, took his seat, intending to wait the approach of dawn; and
then assist the partners of his dangers to escape.&nbsp; But,
observing that the poor ladies appeared parched and exhausted, he
brought a basket of oranges and prevailed on some of them to
refresh themselves by sucking a little of the juice.&nbsp; At
this time they were all tolerably composed, except Miss Mansel,
who was in hysteric fits on the floor of the deck of the
round-house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But on Mr. Meriton&rsquo;s return to the company, he
perceived a considerable alteration in the appearance of the
ship; the sides were visibly giving way; the deck seemed to be
lifting, and he discovered other strong indications that she
could not hold much longer together.&nbsp; On this account, he
attempted to go forward to look out, but immediately saw that the
ship had separated in the middle, and that the forepart having
changed its position, lay rather further out towards the
sea.&nbsp; In such an emergency, when the next moment might
plunge him into eternity, he determined to seize the present
opportunity, and follow the example of the crew and the soldiers,
who were now quitting the ship in numbers, and making their way
to the shore, though quite ignorant of its nature and
description.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among other expedients, the ensign-staff had been
unshipped, and attempted to be laid between the ship&rsquo;s side
and some of the rocks, but without success, for it snapped
asunder before it reached them.&nbsp; However, by the light of a
lanthorn, which a seaman handed through the skylight of the
round-house to the deck, Mr. Meriton discovered a spar which
appeared to be laid from the ship&rsquo;s side to the rocks, and
on this spar he resolved to attempt his escape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accordingly, lying down upon it, he thrust himself
forward; however, he soon found that it had no communication with
the rock; he reached the end of it, and then slipped off,
receiving a very violent bruise in his fall, and before he could
recover his legs, he was washed off by the surge.&nbsp; He now
supported himself by swimming, until a returning wave dashed him
against the back part of the cavern.&nbsp; Here he laid hold of a
small projection in the rock, but was so much benumbed that he
was on the point of quitting it, when a seaman, who had already
gained a footing, extended his hand, and assisted him until he
could secure himself a little on the rock; from which he
clambered on a shelf still higher, and out of the reach of the
surf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Rogers, the third mate, remained with the captain
and the unfortunate ladies and their companions nearly twenty
minutes after Mr. Meriton had quitted the ship.&nbsp; Soon after
the latter left the round-house, the captain asked what was
become of him, to which Mr. Rogers replied, that he was gone on
deck to see what could be done.&nbsp; After this, a heavy sea
breaking over the ship, the ladies exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, poor
Meriton! he is drowned; had he stayed with us he would have been
safe!&rdquo; and they all, particularly Miss Mary Pierce,
expressed great concern at the apprehension of his loss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sea was now breaking in at the fore part of the
ship, and reached as far as the mainmast.&nbsp; Captain Pierce
gave Mr. Rogers a nod, and they took a lamp and went together
into the stern-gallery, where, after viewing the rocks for some
time, Captain Pierce asked Mr. Rogers if he thought there was any
possibility of saving the girls; to which he replied, he feared
there was none; for they could only discover the black face of
the perpendicular rock, and not the cavern which afforded shelter
to those who escaped.&nbsp; They then returned to the
round-house, where Mr. Rogers hung up the lamp, and Captain
Pierce sat down between his two daughters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sea continuing to break in very fast, Mr. Macmanus,
a midshipman, and Mr. Schutz, a passenger, asked Mr. Rogers what
they could do to escape.&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he
replied, and they all went into the stern-gallery, and from
thence to the upper-quarter-gallery on the poop.&nbsp; While
there, a very heavy sea fell on board, and the round-house gave
way; Mr. Rogers heard the ladies shriek at intervals, as if the
water reached them; the noise of the sea at other times drowning
their voices.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Brimer had followed him to the poop, where they
remained together about five minutes, when on the breaking of
this heavy sea, they jointly seized a hen-coop.&nbsp; The same
wave which proved fatal to some of those below, carried him and
his companion to the rock, on which they were violently dashed
and miserably bruised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here on the rock were twenty-seven men; but it now
being low water, and as they were convinced that on the flowing
of the tide all must be washed off, many attempted to get to the
back or the sides of the cavern, beyond the reach of the
returning sea.&nbsp; Scarcely more than six, besides Mr. Rogers
and Mr. Brimer, succeeded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Rogers, on gaining this station, was so nearly
exhausted, that had his exertions been protracted only a few
minutes longer, he must have sunk under them.&nbsp; He was now
prevented from joining Mr. Meriton, by at least twenty men
between them, none of whom could move, without the imminent peril
of his life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They found that a very considerable number of the crew,
seamen and soldiers, and some petty officers, were in the same
situation as themselves, though many who had reached the rocks
below, perished in attempting to ascend.&nbsp; They could yet
discern some part of the ship, and in their dreary station
solaced themselves with the hopes of its remaining entire until
day-break; for, in the midst of their own distress, the
sufferings of the females on board affected them with the most
poignant anguish; and every sea that broke inspired them with
terror for their safety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, alas, their apprehensions were too soon
realised!&nbsp; Within a very few minutes of the time that Mr.
Rogers gained the rock, an universal shriek, which long vibrated
in their ears, in which the voice of female distress was
lamentably distinguished, announced the dreadful
catastrophe.&nbsp; In a few moments all was hushed, except the
roaring of the winds and the dashing of the waves; the wreck was
buried in the deep, and not an atom of it was ever afterwards
seen.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most beautiful and affecting incident I know, associated
with a shipwreck, succeeds this dismal story for a winter
night.&nbsp; The Grosvenor, East Indiaman, homeward bound, goes
ashore on the coast of Caffraria.&nbsp; It is resolved that the
officers, passengers, and crew, in number one hundred and
thirty-five souls, shall endeavour to penetrate on foot, across
trackless deserts, infested by wild beasts and cruel savages, to
the Dutch settlements at the Cape of Good Hope.&nbsp; With this
forlorn object before them, they finally separate into two
parties&mdash;never more to meet on earth.</p>
<p>There is a solitary child among the passengers&mdash;a little
boy of seven years old who has no relation there; and when the
first party is moving away he cries after some member of it who
has been kind to him.&nbsp; The crying of a child might be
supposed to be a little thing to men in such great extremity; but
it touches them, and he is immediately taken into that
detachment.</p>
<p>From which time forth, this child is sublimely made a sacred
charge.&nbsp; He is pushed, on a little raft, across broad rivers
by the swimming sailors; they carry him by turns through the deep
sand and long grass (he patiently walking at all other times);
they share with him such putrid fish as they find to eat; they
lie down and wait for him when the rough carpenter, who becomes
his especial friend, lags behind.&nbsp; Beset by lions and
tigers, by savages, by thirst, by hunger, by death in a crowd of
ghastly shapes, they never&mdash;O Father of all mankind, thy
name be blessed for it!&mdash;forget this child.&nbsp; The
captain stops exhausted, and his faithful coxswain goes back and
is seen to sit down by his side, and neither of the two shall be
any more beheld until the great last day; but, as the rest go on
for their lives, they take the child with them.&nbsp; The
carpenter dies of poisonous berries eaten in starvation; and the
steward, succeeding to the command of the party, succeeds to the
sacred guardianship of the child.</p>
<p>God knows all he does for the poor baby; how he cheerfully
carries him in his arms when he himself is weak and ill; how he
feeds him when he himself is griped with want; how he folds his
ragged jacket round him, lays his little worn face with a
woman&rsquo;s tenderness upon his sunburnt breast, soothes him in
his sufferings, sings to him as he limps along, unmindful of his
own parched and bleeding feet.&nbsp; Divided for a few days from
the rest, they dig a grave in the sand and bury their good friend
the cooper&mdash;these two companions alone in the
wilderness&mdash;and then the time comes when they both are ill,
and beg their wretched partners in despair, reduced and few in
number now, to wait by them one day.&nbsp; They wait by them one
day, they wait by them two days.&nbsp; On the morning of the
third, they move very softly about, in making their preparations
for the resumption of their journey; for, the child is sleeping
by the fire, and it is agreed with one consent that he shall not
be disturbed until the last moment.&nbsp; The moment comes, the
fire is dying&mdash;and the child is dead.</p>
<p>His faithful friend, the steward, lingers but a little while
behind him.&nbsp; His grief is great, he staggers on for a few
days, lies down in the desert, and dies.&nbsp; But he shall be
re-united in his immortal spirit&mdash;who can doubt
it!&mdash;with the child, when he and the poor carpenter shall be
raised up with the words, &lsquo;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
the least of these, ye have done it unto Me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I recall the dispersal and disappearance of nearly all the
participators in this once famous shipwreck (a mere handful being
recovered at last), and the legends that were long afterwards
revived from time to time among the English officers at the Cape,
of a white woman with an infant, said to have been seen weeping
outside a savage hut far in the interior, who was whisperingly
associated with the remembrance of the missing ladies saved from
the wrecked vessel, and who was often sought but never found,
thoughts of another kind of travel came into my mind.</p>
<p>Thoughts of a voyager unexpectedly summoned from home, who
travelled a vast distance, and could never return.&nbsp; Thoughts
of this unhappy wayfarer in the depths of his sorrow, in the
bitterness of his anguish, in the helplessness of his
self-reproach, in the desperation of his desire to set right what
he had left wrong, and do what he had left undone.</p>
<p>For, there were many, many things he had neglected.&nbsp;
Little matters while he was at home and surrounded by them, but
things of mighty moment when he was at an immeasurable
distance.&nbsp; There were many many blessings that he had
inadequately felt, there were many trivial injuries that he had
not forgiven, there was love that he had but poorly returned,
there was friendship that he had too lightly prized: there were a
million kind words that he might have spoken, a million kind
looks that he might have given, uncountable slight easy deeds in
which he might have been most truly great and good.&nbsp; O for a
day (he would exclaim), for but one day to make amends!&nbsp; But
the sun never shone upon that happy day, and out of his remote
captivity he never came.</p>
<p>Why does this traveller&rsquo;s fate obscure, on New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, the other histories of travellers with which my
mind was filled but now, and cast a solemn shadow over me!&nbsp;
Must I one day make his journey?&nbsp; Even so.&nbsp; Who shall
say, that I may not then be tortured by such late regrets: that I
may not then look from my exile on my empty place and undone
work?&nbsp; I stand upon a sea-shore, where the waves are
years.&nbsp; They break and fall, and I may little heed them;
but, with every wave the sea is rising, and I know that it will
float me on this traveller&rsquo;s voyage at last.</p>
<h2><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>THE
BEGGING-LETTER WRITER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> amount of money he annually
diverts from wholesome and useful purposes in the United Kingdom,
would be a set-off against the Window Tax.&nbsp; He is one of the
most shameless frauds and impositions of this time.&nbsp; In his
idleness, his mendacity, and the immeasurable harm he does to the
deserving,&mdash;dirtying the stream of true benevolence, and
muddling the brains of foolish justices, with inability to
distinguish between the base coin of distress, and the true
currency we have always among us,&mdash;he is more worthy of
Norfolk Island than three-fourths of the worst characters who are
sent there.&nbsp; Under any rational system, he would have been
sent there long ago.</p>
<p>I, the writer of this paper, have been, for some time, a
chosen receiver of Begging Letters.&nbsp; For fourteen years, my
house has been made as regular a Receiving House for such
communications as any one of the great branch Post-Offices is for
general correspondence.&nbsp; I ought to know something of the
Begging-Letter Writer.&nbsp; He has besieged my door at all hours
of the day and night; he has fought my servant; he has lain in
ambush for me, going out and coming in; he has followed me out of
town into the country; he has appeared at provincial hotels,
where I have been staying for only a few hours; he has written to
me from immense distances, when I have been out of England.&nbsp;
He has fallen sick; he has died and been buried; he has come to
life again, and again departed from this transitory scene: he has
been his own son, his own mother, his own baby, his idiot
brother, his uncle, his aunt, his aged grandfather.&nbsp; He has
wanted a greatcoat, to go to India in; a pound to set him up in
life for ever; a pair of boots to take him to the coast of China;
a hat to get him into a permanent situation under
Government.&nbsp; He has frequently been exactly
seven-and-sixpence short of independence.&nbsp; He has had such
openings at Liverpool&mdash;posts of great trust and confidence
in merchants&rsquo; houses, which nothing but seven-and-sixpence
was wanting to him to secure&mdash;that I wonder he is not Mayor
of that flourishing town at the present moment.</p>
<p>The natural phenomena of which he has been the victim, are of
a most astounding nature.&nbsp; He has had two children who have
never grown up; who have never had anything to cover them at
night; who have been continually driving him mad, by asking in
vain for food; who have never come out of fevers and measles
(which, I suppose, has accounted for his fuming his letters with
tobacco smoke, as a disinfectant); who have never changed in the
least degree through fourteen long revolving years.&nbsp; As to
his wife, what that suffering woman has undergone, nobody
knows.&nbsp; She has always been in an interesting situation
through the same long period, and has never been confined
yet.&nbsp; His devotion to her has been unceasing.&nbsp; He has
never cared for himself; he could have perished&mdash;he would
rather, in short&mdash;but was it not his Christian duty as a
man, a husband, and a father,&mdash;to write begging letters when
he looked at her?&nbsp; (He has usually remarked that he would
call in the evening for an answer to this question.)</p>
<p>He has been the sport of the strangest misfortunes.&nbsp; What
his brother has done to him would have broken anybody
else&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; His brother went into business with
him, and ran away with the money; his brother got him to be
security for an immense sum and left him to pay it; his brother
would have given him employment to the tune of hundreds a-year,
if he would have consented to write letters on a Sunday; his
brother enunciated principles incompatible with his religious
views, and he could not (in consequence) permit his brother to
provide for him.&nbsp; His landlord has never shown a spark of
human feeling.&nbsp; When he put in that execution I don&rsquo;t
know, but he has never taken it out.&nbsp; The broker&rsquo;s man
has grown grey in possession.&nbsp; They will have to bury him
some day.</p>
<p>He has been attached to every conceivable pursuit.&nbsp; He
has been in the army, in the navy, in the church, in the law;
connected with the press, the fine arts, public institutions,
every description and grade of business.&nbsp; He has been
brought up as a gentleman; he has been at every college in Oxford
and Cambridge; he can quote Latin in his letters (but generally
misspells some minor English word); he can tell you what
Shakespeare says about begging, better than you know it.&nbsp; It
is to be observed, that in the midst of his afflictions he always
reads the newspapers; and rounds off his appeal with some
allusion, that may be supposed to be in my way, to the popular
subject of the hour.</p>
<p>His life presents a series of inconsistencies.&nbsp; Sometimes
he has never written such a letter before.&nbsp; He blushes with
shame.&nbsp; That is the first time; that shall be the
last.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t answer it, and let it be understood that,
then, he will kill himself quietly.&nbsp; Sometimes (and more
frequently) he <i>has</i> written a few such letters.&nbsp; Then
he encloses the answers, with an intimation that they are of
inestimable value to him, and a request that they may be
carefully returned.&nbsp; He is fond of enclosing
something&mdash;verses, letters, pawnbrokers&rsquo; duplicates,
anything to necessitate an answer.&nbsp; He is very severe upon
&lsquo;the pampered minion of fortune,&rsquo; who refused him the
half-sovereign referred to in the enclosure number two&mdash;but
he knows me better.</p>
<p>He writes in a variety of styles; sometimes in low spirits;
sometimes quite jocosely.&nbsp; When he is in low spirits he
writes down-hill and repeats words&mdash;these little indications
being expressive of the perturbation of his mind.&nbsp; When he
is more vivacious, he is frank with me; he is quite the agreeable
rattle.&nbsp; I know what human nature is,&mdash;who
better?&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; He had a little money once, and he ran
through it&mdash;as many men have done before him.&nbsp; He finds
his old friends turn away from him now&mdash;many men have done
that before him too!&nbsp; Shall he tell me why he writes to
me?&nbsp; Because he has no kind of claim upon me.&nbsp; He puts
it on that ground plainly; and begs to ask for the loan (as I
know human nature) of two sovereigns, to be repaid next Tuesday
six weeks, before twelve at noon.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he is sure that I have found him out, and that
there is no chance of money, he writes to inform me that I have
got rid of him at last.&nbsp; He has enlisted into the
Company&rsquo;s service, and is off directly&mdash;but he wants a
cheese.&nbsp; He is informed by the serjeant that it is essential
to his prospects in the regiment that he should take out a single
Gloucester cheese, weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds.&nbsp;
Eight or nine shillings would buy it.&nbsp; He does not ask for
money, after what has passed; but if he calls at nine, to-morrow
morning may he hope to find a cheese?&nbsp; And is there anything
he can do to show his gratitude in Bengal?</p>
<p>Once he wrote me rather a special letter, proposing relief in
kind.&nbsp; He had got into a little trouble by leaving parcels
of mud done up in brown paper, at people&rsquo;s houses, on
pretence of being a Railway-Porter, in which character he
received carriage money.&nbsp; This sportive fancy he expiated in
the House of Correction.&nbsp; Not long after his release, and on
a Sunday morning, he called with a letter (having first dusted
himself all over), in which he gave me to understand that, being
resolved to earn an honest livelihood, he had been travelling
about the country with a cart of crockery.&nbsp; That he had been
doing pretty well until the day before, when his horse had
dropped down dead near Chatham, in Kent.&nbsp; That this had
reduced him to the unpleasant necessity of getting into the
shafts himself, and drawing the cart of crockery to
London&mdash;a somewhat exhausting pull of thirty miles.&nbsp;
That he did not venture to ask again for money; but that if I
would have the goodness <i>to leave him out a donkey</i>, he
would call for the animal before breakfast!</p>
<p>At another time my friend (I am describing actual experiences)
introduced himself as a literary gentleman in the last extremity
of distress.&nbsp; He had had a play accepted at a certain
Theatre&mdash;which was really open; its representation was
delayed by the indisposition of a leading actor&mdash;who was
really ill; and he and his were in a state of absolute
starvation.&nbsp; If he made his necessities known to the Manager
of the Theatre, he put it to me to say what kind of treatment he
might expect?&nbsp; Well! we got over that difficulty to our
mutual satisfaction.&nbsp; A little while afterwards he was in
some other strait.&nbsp; I think Mrs. Southcote, his wife, was in
extremity&mdash;and we adjusted that point too.&nbsp; A little
while afterwards he had taken a new house, and was going headlong
to ruin for want of a water-butt.&nbsp; I had my misgivings about
the water-butt, and did not reply to that epistle.&nbsp; But a
little while afterwards, I had reason to feel penitent for my
neglect.&nbsp; He wrote me a few broken-hearted lines, informing
me that the dear partner of his sorrows died in his arms last
night at nine o&rsquo;clock!</p>
<p>I despatched a trusty messenger to comfort the bereaved
mourner and his poor children; but the messenger went so soon,
that the play was not ready to be played out; my friend was not
at home, and his wife was in a most delightful state of
health.&nbsp; He was taken up by the Mendicity Society
(informally it afterwards appeared), and I presented myself at a
London Police-Office with my testimony against him.&nbsp; The
Magistrate was wonderfully struck by his educational
acquirements, deeply impressed by the excellence of his letters,
exceedingly sorry to see a man of his attainments there,
complimented him highly on his powers of composition, and was
quite charmed to have the agreeable duty of discharging
him.&nbsp; A collection was made for the &lsquo;poor
fellow,&rsquo; as he was called in the reports, and I left the
court with a comfortable sense of being universally regarded as a
sort of monster.&nbsp; Next day comes to me a friend of mine, the
governor of a large prison.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you ever go to
the Police-Office against that man,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;without coming to me first?&nbsp; I know all about him and
his frauds.&nbsp; He lodged in the house of one of my warders, at
the very time when he first wrote to you; and then he was eating
spring-lamb at eighteen-pence a pound, and early asparagus at I
don&rsquo;t know how much a bundle!&rsquo;&nbsp; On that very
same day, and in that very same hour, my injured gentleman wrote
a solemn address to me, demanding to know what compensation I
proposed to make him for his having passed the night in a
&lsquo;loathsome dungeon.&rsquo;&nbsp; And next morning an Irish
gentleman, a member of the same fraternity, who had read the
case, and was very well persuaded I should be chary of going to
that Police-Office again, positively refused to leave my door for
less than a sovereign, and, resolved to besiege me into
compliance, literally &lsquo;sat down&rsquo; before it for ten
mortal hours.&nbsp; The garrison being well provisioned, I
remained within the walls; and he raised the siege at midnight
with a prodigious alarum on the bell.</p>
<p>The Begging-Letter Writer often has an extensive circle of
acquaintance.&nbsp; Whole pages of the &lsquo;Court Guide&rsquo;
are ready to be references for him.&nbsp; Noblemen and gentlemen
write to say there never was such a man for probity and
virtue.&nbsp; They have known him time out of mind, and there is
nothing they wouldn&rsquo;t do for him.&nbsp; Somehow, they
don&rsquo;t give him that one pound ten he stands in need of; but
perhaps it is not enough&mdash;they want to do more, and his
modesty will not allow it.&nbsp; It is to be remarked of his
trade that it is a very fascinating one.&nbsp; He never leaves
it; and those who are near to him become smitten with a love of
it, too, and sooner or later set up for themselves.&nbsp; He
employs a messenger&mdash;man, woman, or child.&nbsp; That
messenger is certain ultimately to become an independent
Begging-Letter Writer.&nbsp; His sons and daughters succeed to
his calling, and write begging-letters when he is no more.&nbsp;
He throws off the infection of begging-letter writing, like the
contagion of disease.&nbsp; What Sydney Smith so happily called
&lsquo;the dangerous luxury of dishonesty&rsquo; is more
tempting, and more catching, it would seem, in this instance than
in any other.</p>
<p>He always belongs to a Corresponding-Society of Begging-Letter
Writers.&nbsp; Any one who will, may ascertain this fact.&nbsp;
Give money to-day in recognition of a begging-letter,&mdash;no
matter how unlike a common begging-letter,&mdash;and for the next
fortnight you will have a rush of such communications.&nbsp;
Steadily refuse to give; and the begging-letters become
Angels&rsquo; visits, until the Society is from some cause or
other in a dull way of business, and may as well try you as
anybody else.&nbsp; It is of little use inquiring into the
Begging-Letter Writer&rsquo;s circumstances.&nbsp; He may be
sometimes accidentally found out, as in the case already
mentioned (though that was not the first inquiry made); but
apparent misery is always a part of his trade, and real misery
very often is, in the intervals of spring-lamb and early
asparagus.&nbsp; It is naturally an incident of his dissipated
and dishonest life.</p>
<p>That the calling is a successful one, and that large sums of
money are gained by it, must be evident to anybody who reads the
Police Reports of such cases.&nbsp; But, prosecutions are of rare
occurrence, relatively to the extent to which the trade is
carried on.&nbsp; The cause of this is to be found (as no one
knows better than the Begging-Letter Writer, for it is a part of
his speculation) in the aversion people feel to exhibit
themselves as having been imposed upon, or as having weakly
gratified their consciences with a lazy, flimsy substitute for
the noblest of all virtues.&nbsp; There is a man at large, at the
moment when this paper is preparing for the press (on the 29th of
April, 1850), and never once taken up yet, who, within these
twelvemonths, has been probably the most audacious and the most
successful swindler that even this trade has ever known.&nbsp;
There has been something singularly base in this fellow&rsquo;s
proceedings; it has been his business to write to all sorts and
conditions of people, in the names of persons of high reputation
and unblemished honour, professing to be in distress&mdash;the
general admiration and respect for whom has ensured a ready and
generous reply.</p>
<p>Now, in the hope that the results of the real experience of a
real person may do something more to induce reflection on this
subject than any abstract treatise&mdash;and with a personal
knowledge of the extent to which the Begging-Letter Trade has
been carried on for some time, and has been for some time
constantly increasing&mdash;the writer of this paper entreats the
attention of his readers to a few concluding words.&nbsp; His
experience is a type of the experience of many; some on a
smaller, some on an infinitely larger scale.&nbsp; All may judge
of the soundness or unsoundness of his conclusions from it.</p>
<p>Long doubtful of the efficacy of such assistance in any case
whatever, and able to recall but one, within his whole individual
knowledge, in which he had the least after-reason to suppose that
any good was done by it, he was led, last autumn, into some
serious considerations.&nbsp; The begging-letters flying about by
every post, made it perfectly manifest that a set of lazy
vagabonds were interposed between the general desire to do
something to relieve the sickness and misery under which the poor
were suffering, and the suffering poor themselves.&nbsp; That
many who sought to do some little to repair the social wrongs,
inflicted in the way of preventible sickness and death upon the
poor, were strengthening those wrongs, however innocently, by
wasting money on pestilent knaves cumbering society.&nbsp; That
imagination,&mdash;soberly following one of these knaves into his
life of punishment in jail, and comparing it with the life of one
of these poor in a cholera-stricken alley, or one of the children
of one of these poor, soothed in its dying hour by the late
lamented Mr. Drouet,&mdash;contemplated a grim farce, impossible
to be presented very much longer before God or man.&nbsp; That
the crowning miracle of all the miracles summed up in the New
Testament, after the miracle of the blind seeing, and the lame
walking, and the restoration of the dead to life, was the miracle
that the poor had the Gospel preached to them.&nbsp; That while
the poor were unnaturally and unnecessarily cut off by the
thousand, in the prematurity of their age, or in the rottenness
of their youth&mdash;for of flower or blossom such youth has
none&mdash;the Gospel was <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span>
preached to them, saving in hollow and unmeaning voices.&nbsp;
That of all wrongs, this was the first mighty wrong the
Pestilence warned us to set right.&nbsp; And that no Post-Office
Order to any amount, given to a Begging-Letter Writer for the
quieting of an uneasy breast, would be presentable on the Last
Great Day as anything towards it.</p>
<p>The poor never write these letters.&nbsp; Nothing could be
more unlike their habits.&nbsp; The writers are public robbers;
and we who support them are parties to their depredations.&nbsp;
They trade upon every circumstance within their knowledge that
affects us, public or private, joyful or sorrowful; they pervert
the lessons of our lives; they change what ought to be our
strength and virtue into weakness, and encouragement of
vice.&nbsp; There is a plain remedy, and it is in our own
hands.&nbsp; We must resolve, at any sacrifice of feeling, to be
deaf to such appeals, and crush the trade.</p>
<p>There are degrees in murder.&nbsp; Life must be held sacred
among us in more ways than one&mdash;sacred, not merely from the
murderous weapon, or the subtle poison, or the cruel blow, but
sacred from preventible diseases, distortions, and pains.&nbsp;
That is the first great end we have to set against this miserable
imposition.&nbsp; Physical life respected, moral life comes
next.&nbsp; What will not content a Begging-Letter Writer for a
week, would educate a score of children for a year.&nbsp; Let us
give all we can; let us give more than ever.&nbsp; Let us do all
we can; let us do more than ever.&nbsp; But let us give, and do,
with a high purpose; not to endow the scum of the earth, to its
own greater corruption, with the offals of our duty.</p>
<h2><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>A
CHILD&rsquo;S DREAM OF A STAR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a child, and he
strolled about a good deal, and thought of a number of
things.&nbsp; He had a sister, who was a child too, and his
constant companion.&nbsp; These two used to wonder all day
long.&nbsp; They wondered at the beauty of the flowers; they
wondered at the height and blueness of the sky; they wondered at
the depth of the bright water; they wondered at the goodness and
the power of <span class="smcap">God</span> who made the lovely
world.</p>
<p>They used to say to one another, sometimes, Supposing all the
children upon earth were to die, would the flowers, and the
water, and the sky be sorry?&nbsp; They believed they would be
sorry.&nbsp; For, said they, the buds are the children of the
flowers, and the little playful streams that gambol down the
hill-sides are the children of the water; and the smallest bright
specks playing at hide and seek in the sky all night, must surely
be the children of the stars; and they would all be grieved to
see their playmates, the children of men, no more.</p>
<p>There was one clear shining star that used to come out in the
sky before the rest, near the church spire, above the
graves.&nbsp; It was larger and more beautiful, they thought,
than all the others, and every night they watched for it,
standing hand in hand at a window.&nbsp; Whoever saw it first
cried out, &lsquo;I see the star!&rsquo;&nbsp; And often they
cried out both together, knowing so well when it would rise, and
where.&nbsp; So they grew to be such friends with it, that,
before lying down in their beds, they always looked out once
again, to bid it good night; and when they were turning round to
sleep, they used to say, &lsquo;God bless the star!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But while she was still very young, oh, very, very young, the
sister drooped, and came to be so weak that she could no longer
stand in the window at night; and then the child looked sadly out
by himself, and when he saw the star, turned round and said to
the patient pale face on the bed, &lsquo;I see the star!&rsquo;
and then a smile would come upon the face, and a little weak
voice used to say, &lsquo;God bless my brother and the
star!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so the time came all too soon! when the child looked out
alone, and when there was no face on the bed; and when there was
a little grave among the graves, not there before; and when the
star made long rays down towards him, as he saw it through his
tears.</p>
<p>Now, these rays were so bright, and they seemed to make such a
shining way from earth to Heaven, that when the child went to his
solitary bed, he dreamed about the star; and dreamed that, lying
where he was, he saw a train of people taken up that sparkling
road by angels.&nbsp; And the star, opening, showed him a great
world of light, where many more such angels waited to receive
them.</p>
<p>All these angels, who were waiting, turned their beaming eyes
upon the people who were carried up into the star; and some came
out from the long rows in which they stood, and fell upon the
people&rsquo;s necks, and kissed them tenderly, and went away
with them down avenues of light, and were so happy in their
company, that lying in his bed he wept for joy.</p>
<p>But, there were many angels who did not go with them, and
among them one he knew.&nbsp; The patient face that once had lain
upon the bed was glorified and radiant, but his heart found out
his sister among all the host.</p>
<p>His sister&rsquo;s angel lingered near the entrance of the
star, and said to the leader among those who had brought the
people thither:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is my brother come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was turning hopefully away, when the child stretched out
his arms, and cried, &lsquo;O, sister, I am here!&nbsp; Take
me!&rsquo; and then she turned her beaming eyes upon him, and it
was night; and the star was shining into the room, making long
rays down towards him as he saw it through his tears.</p>
<p>From that hour forth, the child looked out upon the star as on
the home he was to go to, when his time should come; and he
thought that he did not belong to the earth alone, but to the
star too, because of his sister&rsquo;s angel gone before.</p>
<p>There was a baby born to be a brother to the child; and while
he was so little that he never yet had spoken word, he stretched
his tiny form out on his bed, and died.</p>
<p>Again the child dreamed of the open star, and of the company
of angels, and the train of people, and the rows of angels with
their beaming eyes all turned upon those people&rsquo;s
faces.</p>
<p>Said his sister&rsquo;s angel to the leader:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is my brother come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &lsquo;Not that one, but another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the child beheld his brother&rsquo;s angel in her arms, he
cried, &lsquo;O, sister, I am here!&nbsp; Take me!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And she turned and smiled upon him, and the star was shining.</p>
<p>He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books when an
old servant came to him and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thy mother is no more.&nbsp; I bring her blessing on
her darling son!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again at night he saw the star, and all that former
company.&nbsp; Said his sister&rsquo;s angel to the leader.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is my brother come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &lsquo;Thy mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star, because
the mother was re-united to her two children.&nbsp; And he
stretched out his arms and cried, &lsquo;O, mother, sister, and
brother, I am here!&nbsp; Take me!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they answered
him, &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; and the star was shining.</p>
<p>He grew to be a man, whose hair was turning grey, and he was
sitting in his chair by the fireside, heavy with grief, and with
his face bedewed with tears, when the star opened once again.</p>
<p>Said his sister&rsquo;s angel to the leader: &lsquo;Is my
brother come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &lsquo;Nay, but his maiden daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly
lost to him, a celestial creature among those three, and he said,
&lsquo;My daughter&rsquo;s head is on my sister&rsquo;s bosom,
and her arm is around my mother&rsquo;s neck, and at her feet
there is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from
her, <span class="smcap">God</span> be praised!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the star was shining.</p>
<p>Thus the child came to be an old man, and his once smooth face
was wrinkled, and his steps were slow and feeble, and his back
was bent.&nbsp; And one night as he lay upon his bed, his
children standing round, he cried, as he had cried so long
ago:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see the star!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They whispered one another, &lsquo;He is dying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &lsquo;I am.&nbsp; My age is falling from me like
a garment, and I move towards the star as a child.&nbsp; And O,
my Father, now I thank thee that it has so often opened, to
receive those dear ones who await me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the star was shining; and it shines upon his grave.</p>
<h2><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>OUR
ENGLISH WATERING-PLACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Autumn-time of the year,
when the great metropolis is so much hotter, so much noisier, so
much more dusty or so much more water-carted, so much more
crowded, so much more disturbing and distracting in all respects,
than it usually is, a quiet sea-beach becomes indeed a blessed
spot.&nbsp; Half awake and half asleep, this idle morning in our
sunny window on the edge of a chalk-cliff in the old-fashioned
watering-place to which we are a faithful resorter, we feel a
lazy inclination to sketch its picture.</p>
<p>The place seems to respond.&nbsp; Sky, sea, beach, and
village, lie as still before us as if they were sitting for the
picture.&nbsp; It is dead low-water.&nbsp; A ripple plays among
the ripening corn upon the cliff, as if it were faintly trying
from recollection to imitate the sea; and the world of
butterflies hovering over the crop of radish-seed are as restless
in their little way as the gulls are in their larger manner when
the wind blows.&nbsp; But the ocean lies winking in the sunlight
like a drowsy lion&mdash;its glassy waters scarcely curve upon
the shore&mdash;the fishing-boats in the tiny harbour are all
stranded in the mud&mdash;our two colliers (our watering-place
has a maritime trade employing that amount of shipping) have not
an inch of water within a quarter of a mile of them, and turn,
exhausted, on their sides, like faint fish of an antediluvian
species.&nbsp; Rusty cables and chains, ropes and rings,
undermost parts of posts and piles and confused timber-defences
against the waves, lie strewn about, in a brown litter of tangled
sea-weed and fallen cliff which looks as if a family of giants
had been making tea here for ages, and had observed an untidy
custom of throwing their tea-leaves on the shore.</p>
<p>In truth, our watering-place itself has been left somewhat
high and dry by the tide of years.&nbsp; Concerned as we are for
its honour, we must reluctantly admit that the time when this
pretty little semicircular sweep of houses, tapering off at the
end of the wooden pier into a point in the sea, was a gay place,
and when the lighthouse overlooking it shone at daybreak on
company dispersing from public balls, is but dimly traditional
now.&nbsp; There is a bleak chamber in our watering-place which
is yet called the Assembly &lsquo;Rooms,&rsquo; and understood to
be available on hire for balls or concerts; and, some few seasons
since, an ancient little gentleman came down and stayed at the
hotel, who said that he had danced there, in bygone ages, with
the Honourable Miss Peepy, well known to have been the Beauty of
her day and the cruel occasion of innumerable duels.&nbsp; But he
was so old and shrivelled, and so very rheumatic in the legs,
that it demanded more imagination than our watering-place can
usually muster, to believe him; therefore, except the Master of
the &lsquo;Rooms&rsquo; (who to this hour wears knee-breeches,
and who confirmed the statement with tears in his eyes), nobody
did believe in the little lame old gentleman, or even in the
Honourable Miss Peepy, long deceased.</p>
<p>As to subscription balls in the Assembly Rooms of our
watering-place now, red-hot cannon balls are less
improbable.&nbsp; Sometimes, a misguided wanderer of a
Ventriloquist, or an Infant Phenomenon, or a juggler, or somebody
with an Orrery that is several stars behind the time, takes the
place for a night, and issues bills with the name of his last
town lined out, and the name of ours ignominiously written in,
but you may be sure this never happens twice to the same
unfortunate person.&nbsp; On such occasions the discoloured old
Billiard Table that is seldom played at (unless the ghost of the
Honourable Miss Peepy plays at pool with other ghosts) is pushed
into a corner, and benches are solemnly constituted into front
seats, back seats, and reserved seats&mdash;which are much the
same after you have paid&mdash;and a few dull candles are
lighted&mdash;wind permitting&mdash;and the performer and the
scanty audience play out a short match which shall make the other
most low-spirited&mdash;which is usually a drawn game.&nbsp;
After that, the performer instantly departs with maledictory
expressions, and is never heard of more.</p>
<p>But the most wonderful feature of our Assembly Rooms, is, that
an annual sale of &lsquo;Fancy and other China,&rsquo; is
announced here with mysterious constancy and perseverance.&nbsp;
Where the china comes from, where it goes to, why it is annually
put up to auction when nobody ever thinks of bidding for it, how
it comes to pass that it is always the same china, whether it
would not have been cheaper, with the sea at hand, to have thrown
it away, say in eighteen hundred and thirty, are standing
enigmas.&nbsp; Every year the bills come out, every year the
Master of the Rooms gets into a little pulpit on a table, and
offers it for sale, every year nobody buys it, every year it is
put away somewhere till next year, when it appears again as if
the whole thing were a new idea.&nbsp; We have a faint
remembrance of an unearthly collection of clocks, purporting to
be the work of Parisian and Genevese artists&mdash;chiefly
bilious-faced clocks, supported on sickly white crutches, with
their pendulums dangling like lame legs&mdash;to which a similar
course of events occurred for several years, until they seemed to
lapse away, of mere imbecility.</p>
<p>Attached to our Assembly Rooms is a library.&nbsp; There is a
wheel of fortune in it, but it is rusty and dusty, and never
turns.&nbsp; A large doll, with moveable eyes, was put up to be
raffled for, by five-and-twenty members at two shillings, seven
years ago this autumn, and the list is not full yet.&nbsp; We are
rather sanguine, now, that the raffle will come off next
year.&nbsp; We think so, because we only want nine members, and
should only want eight, but for number two having grown up since
her name was entered, and withdrawn it when she was
married.&nbsp; Down the street, there is a toy-ship of
considerable burden, in the same condition.&nbsp; Two of the boys
who were entered for that raffle have gone to India in real
ships, since; and one was shot, and died in the arms of his
sister&rsquo;s lover, by whom he sent his last words home.</p>
<p>This is the library for the Minerva Press.&nbsp; If you want
that kind of reading, come to our watering-place.&nbsp; The
leaves of the romances, reduced to a condition very like
curl-paper, are thickly studded with notes in pencil: sometimes
complimentary, sometimes jocose.&nbsp; Some of these
commentators, like commentators in a more extensive way, quarrel
with one another.&nbsp; One young gentleman who sarcastically
writes &lsquo;O!!!&rsquo; after every sentimental passage, is
pursued through his literary career by another, who writes
&lsquo;Insulting Beast!&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Julia Mills has read
the whole collection of these books.&nbsp; She has left marginal
notes on the pages, as &lsquo;Is not this truly touching?&nbsp;
J. M.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How thrilling!&nbsp; J. M.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Entranced here by the Magician&rsquo;s potent spell.&nbsp;
J. M.&rsquo;&nbsp; She has also italicised her favourite traits
in the description of the hero, as &lsquo;his hair, which was
<i>dark</i> and <i>wavy</i>, clustered in <i>rich profusion</i>
around a <i>marble brow</i>, whose lofty paleness bespoke the
intellect within.&rsquo;&nbsp; It reminds her of another
hero.&nbsp; She adds, &lsquo;How like B. L.&nbsp; Can this be
mere coincidence?&nbsp; J. M.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You would hardly guess which is the main street of our
watering-place, but you may know it by its being always stopped
up with donkey-chaises.&nbsp; Whenever you come here, and see
harnessed donkeys eating clover out of barrows drawn completely
across a narrow thoroughfare, you may be quite sure you are in
our High Street.&nbsp; Our Police you may know by his uniform,
likewise by his never on any account interfering with
anybody&mdash;especially the tramps and vagabonds.&nbsp; In our
fancy shops we have a capital collection of damaged goods, among
which the flies of countless summers &lsquo;have been
roaming.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are great in obsolete seals, and in
faded pin-cushions, and in rickety camp-stools, and in exploded
cutlery, and in miniature vessels, and in stunted little
telescopes, and in objects made of shells that pretend not to be
shells.&nbsp; Diminutive spades, barrows, and baskets, are our
principal articles of commerce; but even they don&rsquo;t look
quite new somehow.&nbsp; They always seem to have been offered
and refused somewhere else, before they came down to our
watering-place.</p>
<p>Yet, it must not be supposed that our watering-place is an
empty place, deserted by all visitors except a few staunch
persons of approved fidelity.&nbsp; On the contrary, the chances
are that if you came down here in August or September, you
wouldn&rsquo;t find a house to lay your head in.&nbsp; As to
finding either house or lodging of which you could reduce the
terms, you could scarcely engage in a more hopeless
pursuit.&nbsp; For all this, you are to observe that every season
is the worst season ever known, and that the householding
population of our watering-place are ruined regularly every
autumn.&nbsp; They are like the farmers, in regard that it is
surprising how much ruin they will bear.&nbsp; We have an
excellent hotel&mdash;capital baths, warm, cold, and
shower&mdash;first-rate bathing-machines&mdash;and as good
butchers, bakers, and grocers, as heart could desire.&nbsp; They
all do business, it is to be presumed, from motives of
philanthropy&mdash;but it is quite certain that they are all
being ruined.&nbsp; Their interest in strangers, and their
politeness under ruin, bespeak their amiable nature.&nbsp; You
would say so, if you only saw the baker helping a new comer to
find suitable apartments.</p>
<p>So far from being at a discount as to company, we are in fact
what would be popularly called rather a nobby place.&nbsp; Some
tip-top &lsquo;Nobbs&rsquo; come down occasionally&mdash;even
Dukes and Duchesses.&nbsp; We have known such carriages to blaze
among the donkey-chaises, as made beholders wink.&nbsp; Attendant
on these equipages come resplendent creatures in plush and
powder, who are sure to be stricken disgusted with the
indifferent accommodation of our watering-place, and who, of an
evening (particularly when it rains), may be seen very much out
of drawing, in rooms far too small for their fine figures,
looking discontentedly out of little back windows into
bye-streets.&nbsp; The lords and ladies get on well enough and
quite good-humouredly: but if you want to see the gorgeous
phenomena who wait upon them at a perfect non-plus, you should
come and look at the resplendent creatures with little back
parlours for servants&rsquo; halls, and turn-up bedsteads to
sleep in, at our watering-place.&nbsp; You have no idea how they
take it to heart.</p>
<p>We have a pier&mdash;a queer old wooden pier, fortunately
without the slightest pretensions to architecture, and very
picturesque in consequence.&nbsp; Boats are hauled up upon it,
ropes are coiled all over it; lobster-pots, nets, masts, oars,
spars, sails, ballast, and rickety capstans, make a perfect
labyrinth of it.&nbsp; For ever hovering about this pier, with
their hands in their pockets, or leaning over the rough bulwark
it opposes to the sea, gazing through telescopes which they carry
about in the same profound receptacles, are the Boatmen of our
watering-place.&nbsp; Looking at them, you would say that surely
these must be the laziest boatmen in the world.&nbsp; They lounge
about, in obstinate and inflexible pantaloons that are apparently
made of wood, the whole season through.&nbsp; Whether talking
together about the shipping in the Channel, or gruffly unbending
over mugs of beer at the public-house, you would consider them
the slowest of men.&nbsp; The chances are a thousand to one that
you might stay here for ten seasons, and never see a boatman in a
hurry.&nbsp; A certain expression about his loose hands, when
they are not in his pockets, as if he were carrying a
considerable lump of iron in each, without any inconvenience,
suggests strength, but he never seems to use it.&nbsp; He has the
appearance of perpetually strolling&mdash;running is too
inappropriate a word to be thought of&mdash;to seed.&nbsp; The
only subject on which he seems to feel any approach to
enthusiasm, is pitch.&nbsp; He pitches everything he can lay hold
of,&mdash;the pier, the palings, his boat, his house,&mdash;when
there is nothing else left he turns to and even pitches his hat,
or his rough-weather clothing.&nbsp; Do not judge him by
deceitful appearances.&nbsp; These are among the bravest and most
skilful mariners that exist.&nbsp; Let a gale arise and swell
into a storm, let a sea run that might appal the stoutest heart
that ever beat, let the Light-boat on these dangerous sands throw
up a rocket in the night, or let them hear through the angry roar
the signal-guns of a ship in distress, and these men spring up
into activity so dauntless, so valiant, and heroic, that the
world cannot surpass it.&nbsp; Cavillers may object that they
chiefly live upon the salvage of valuable cargoes.&nbsp; So they
do, and God knows it is no great living that they get out of the
deadly risks they run.&nbsp; But put that hope of gain
aside.&nbsp; Let these rough fellows be asked, in any storm, who
volunteers for the life-boat to save some perishing souls, as
poor and empty-handed as themselves, whose lives the perfection
of human reason does not rate at the value of a farthing each;
and that boat will be manned, as surely and as cheerfully, as if
a thousand pounds were told down on the weather-beaten
pier.&nbsp; For this, and for the recollection of their comrades
whom we have known, whom the raging sea has engulfed before their
children&rsquo;s eyes in such brave efforts, whom the secret sand
has buried, we hold the boatmen of our watering-place in our love
and honour, and are tender of the fame they well deserve.</p>
<p>So many children are brought down to our watering-place that,
when they are not out of doors, as they usually are in fine
weather, it is wonderful where they are put: the whole village
seeming much too small to hold them under cover.&nbsp; In the
afternoons, you see no end of salt and sandy little boots drying
on upper window-sills.&nbsp; At bathing-time in the morning, the
little bay re-echoes with every shrill variety of shriek and
splash&mdash;after which, if the weather be at all fresh, the
sands teem with small blue mottled legs.&nbsp; The sands are the
children&rsquo;s great resort.&nbsp; They cluster there, like
ants: so busy burying their particular friends, and making
castles with infinite labour which the next tide overthrows, that
it is curious to consider how their play, to the music of the
sea, foreshadows the realities of their after lives.</p>
<p>It is curious, too, to observe a natural ease of approach that
there seems to be between the children and the boatmen.&nbsp;
They mutually make acquaintance, and take individual likings,
without any help.&nbsp; You will come upon one of those slow
heavy fellows sitting down patiently mending a little ship for a
mite of a boy, whom he could crush to death by throwing his
lightest pair of trousers on him.&nbsp; You will be sensible of
the oddest contrast between the smooth little creature, and the
rough man who seems to be carved out of hard-grained
wood&mdash;between the delicate hand expectantly held out, and
the immense thumb and finger that can hardly feel the rigging of
thread they mend&mdash;between the small voice and the gruff
growl&mdash;and yet there is a natural propriety in the
companionship: always to be noted in confidence between a child
and a person who has any merit of reality and genuineness: which
is admirably pleasant.</p>
<p>We have a preventive station at our watering-place, and much
the same thing may be observed&mdash;in a lesser degree, because
of their official character&mdash;of the coast blockade; a
steady, trusty, well-conditioned, well-conducted set of men, with
no misgiving about looking you full in the face, and with a quiet
thorough-going way of passing along to their duty at night,
carrying huge sou&rsquo;-wester clothing in reserve, that is
fraught with all good prepossession.&nbsp; They are handy
fellows&mdash;neat about their houses&mdash;industrious at
gardening&mdash;would get on with their wives, one thinks, in a
desert island&mdash;and people it, too, soon.</p>
<p>As to the naval officer of the station, with his hearty fresh
face, and his blue eye that has pierced all kinds of weather, it
warms our hearts when he comes into church on a Sunday, with that
bright mixture of blue coat, buff waistcoat, black neck-kerchief,
and gold epaulette, that is associated in the minds of all
Englishmen with brave, unpretending, cordial, national
service.&nbsp; We like to look at him in his Sunday state; and if
we were First Lord (really possessing the indispensable
qualification for the office of knowing nothing whatever about
the sea), we would give him a ship to-morrow.</p>
<p>We have a church, by-the-by, of course&mdash;a hideous temple
of flint, like a great petrified haystack.&nbsp; Our chief
clerical dignitary, who, to his honour, has done much for
education both in time and money, and has established excellent
schools, is a sound, shrewd, healthy gentleman, who has got into
little occasional difficulties with the neighbouring farmers, but
has had a pestilent trick of being right.&nbsp; Under a new
regulation, he has yielded the church of our watering-place to
another clergyman.&nbsp; Upon the whole we get on in church
well.&nbsp; We are a little bilious sometimes, about these days
of fraternisation, and about nations arriving at a new and more
unprejudiced knowledge of each other (which our Christianity
don&rsquo;t quite approve), but it soon goes off, and then we get
on very well.</p>
<p>There are two dissenting chapels, besides, in our small
watering-place; being in about the proportion of a hundred and
twenty guns to a yacht.&nbsp; But the dissension that has torn us
lately, has not been a religious one.&nbsp; It has arisen on the
novel question of Gas.&nbsp; Our watering-place has been
convulsed by the agitation, Gas or No Gas.&nbsp; It was never
reasoned why No Gas, but there was a great No Gas party.&nbsp;
Broadsides were printed and stuck about&mdash;a startling
circumstance in our watering-place.&nbsp; The No Gas party rested
content with chalking &lsquo;No Gas!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Down with
Gas!&rsquo; and other such angry war-whoops, on the few back
gates and scraps of wall which the limits of our watering-place
afford; but the Gas party printed and posted bills, wherein they
took the high ground of proclaiming against the No Gas party,
that it was said Let there be light and there was light; and that
not to have light (that is gas-light) in our watering-place, was
to contravene the great decree.&nbsp; Whether by these
thunderbolts or not, the No Gas party were defeated; and in this
present season we have had our handful of shops illuminated for
the first time.&nbsp; Such of the No Gas party, however, as have
got shops, remain in opposition and burn tallow&mdash;exhibiting
in their windows the very picture of the sulkiness that punishes
itself, and a new illustration of the old adage about cutting off
your nose to be revenged on your face, in cutting off their gas
to be revenged on their business.</p>
<p>Other population than we have indicated, our watering-place
has none.&nbsp; There are a few old used-up boatmen who creep
about in the sunlight with the help of sticks, and there is a
poor imbecile shoemaker who wanders his lonely life away among
the rocks, as if he were looking for his reason&mdash;which he
will never find.&nbsp; Sojourners in neighbouring watering-places
come occasionally in flys to stare at us, and drive away again as
if they thought us very dull; Italian boys come, Punch comes, the
Fantoccini come, the Tumblers come, the Ethiopians come;
Glee-singers come at night, and hum and vibrate (not always
melodiously) under our windows.&nbsp; But they all go soon, and
leave us to ourselves again.&nbsp; We once had a travelling
Circus and Wombwell&rsquo;s Menagerie at the same time.&nbsp;
They both know better than ever to try it again; and the
Menagerie had nearly razed us from the face of the earth in
getting the elephant away&mdash;his caravan was so large, and the
watering-place so small.&nbsp; We have a fine sea, wholesome for
all people; profitable for the body, profitable for the
mind.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s words are sometimes on its awful
lips:</p>
<blockquote><p>And the stately ships go on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To their haven under the hill;<br />
But O for the touch of a vanish&rsquo;d hand.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sound of a voice that is still!<br />
<br />
Break, break, break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the foot of thy crags, O sea!<br />
But the tender grace of a day that is dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will never come back to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it is not always so, for the speech of the sea is various,
and wants not abundant resource of cheerfulness, hope, and lusty
encouragement.&nbsp; And since I have been idling at the window
here, the tide has risen.&nbsp; The boats are dancing on the
bubbling water; the colliers are afloat again; the white-bordered
waves rush in; the children</p>
<blockquote><p>Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him<br />
When he comes back;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the radiant sails are gliding past the shore, and shining on
the far horizon; all the sea is sparkling, heaving, swelling up
with life and beauty, this bright morning.</p>
<h2><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>OUR
FRENCH WATERING-PLACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> earned, by many years of
fidelity, the right to be sometimes inconstant to our English
watering-place, we have dallied for two or three seasons with a
French watering-place: once solely known to us as a town with a
very long street, beginning with an abattoir and ending with a
steam-boat, which it seemed our fate to behold only at daybreak
on winter mornings, when (in the days before continental
railroads), just sufficiently awake to know that we were most
uncomfortably asleep, it was our destiny always to clatter
through it, in the coup&eacute; of the diligence from Paris, with
a sea of mud behind us, and a sea of tumbling waves before.&nbsp;
In relation to which latter monster, our mind&rsquo;s eye now
recalls a worthy Frenchman in a seal-skin cap with a braided hood
over it, once our travelling companion in the coup&eacute;
aforesaid, who, waking up with a pale and crumpled visage, and
looking ruefully out at the grim row of breakers enjoying
themselves fanatically on an instrument of torture called
&lsquo;the Bar,&rsquo; inquired of us whether we were ever sick
at sea?&nbsp; Both to prepare his mind for the abject creature we
were presently to become, and also to afford him consolation, we
replied, &lsquo;Sir, your servant is always sick when it is
possible to be so.&rsquo;&nbsp; He returned, altogether uncheered
by the bright example, &lsquo;Ah, Heaven, but I am always sick,
even when it is impossible to be so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The means of communication between the French capital and our
French watering-place are wholly changed since those days; but,
the Channel remains unbridged as yet, and the old floundering and
knocking about go on there.&nbsp; It must be confessed that
saving in reasonable (and therefore rare) sea-weather, the act of
arrival at our French watering-place from England is difficult to
be achieved with dignity.&nbsp; Several little circumstances
combine to render the visitor an object of humiliation.&nbsp; In
the first place, the steamer no sooner touches the port, than all
the passengers fall into captivity: being boarded by an
overpowering force of Custom-house officers, and marched into a
gloomy dungeon.&nbsp; In the second place, the road to this
dungeon is fenced off with ropes breast-high, and outside those
ropes all the English in the place who have lately been sea-sick
and are now well, assemble in their best clothes to enjoy the
degradation of their dilapidated fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, my gracious! how ill this one has been!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a damp one coming next!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a pale one!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t he green in the face, this next one!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Even we ourself (not deficient in natural dignity) have a lively
remembrance of staggering up this detested lane one September day
in a gale of wind, when we were received like an irresistible
comic actor, with a burst of laughter and applause, occasioned by
the extreme imbecility of our legs.</p>
<p>We were coming to the third place.&nbsp; In the third place,
the captives, being shut up in the gloomy dungeon, are strained,
two or three at a time, into an inner cell, to be examined as to
passports; and across the doorway of communication, stands a
military creature making a bar of his arm.&nbsp; Two ideas are
generally present to the British mind during these ceremonies;
first, that it is necessary to make for the cell with violent
struggles, as if it were a life-boat and the dungeon a ship going
down; secondly, that the military creature&rsquo;s arm is a
national affront, which the government at home ought instantly to
&lsquo;take up.&rsquo;&nbsp; The British mind and body becoming
heated by these fantasies, delirious answers are made to
inquiries, and extravagant actions performed.&nbsp; Thus, Johnson
persists in giving Johnson as his baptismal name, and
substituting for his ancestral designation the national
&lsquo;Dam!&rsquo;&nbsp; Neither can he by any means be brought
to recognise the distinction between a portmanteau-key and a
passport, but will obstinately persevere in tendering the one
when asked for the other.&nbsp; This brings him to the fourth
place, in a state of mere idiotcy; and when he is, in the fourth
place, cast out at a little door into a howling wilderness of
touters, he becomes a lunatic with wild eyes and floating hair
until rescued and soothed.&nbsp; If friendless and unrescued, he
is generally put into a railway omnibus and taken to Paris.</p>
<p>But, our French watering-place, when it is once got into, is a
very enjoyable place.&nbsp; It has a varied and beautiful country
around it, and many characteristic and agreeable things within
it.&nbsp; To be sure, it might have fewer bad smells and less
decaying refuse, and it might be better drained, and much cleaner
in many parts, and therefore infinitely more healthy.&nbsp;
Still, it is a bright, airy, pleasant, cheerful town; and if you
were to walk down either of its three well-paved main streets,
towards five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when delicate odours
of cookery fill the air, and its hotel windows (it is full of
hotels) give glimpses of long tables set out for dinner, and made
to look sumptuous by the aid of napkins folded fan-wise, you
would rightly judge it to be an uncommonly good town to eat and
drink in.</p>
<p>We have an old walled town, rich in cool public wells of
water, on the top of a hill within and above the present
business-town; and if it were some hundreds of miles further from
England, instead of being, on a clear day, within sight of the
grass growing in the crevices of the chalk-cliffs of Dover, you
would long ago have been bored to death about that town.&nbsp; It
is more picturesque and quaint than half the innocent places
which tourists, following their leader like sheep, have made
impostors of.&nbsp; To say nothing of its houses with grave
courtyards, its queer by-corners, and its many-windowed streets
white and quiet in the sunlight, there is an ancient belfry in it
that would have been in all the Annuals and Albums, going and
gone, these hundred years if it had but been more expensive to
get at.&nbsp; Happily it has escaped so well, being only in our
French watering-place, that you may like it of your own accord in
a natural manner, without being required to go into convulsions
about it.&nbsp; We regard it as one of the later blessings of our
life, that <span class="smcap">Bilkins</span>, the only authority
on Taste, never took any notice that we can find out, of our
French watering-place.&nbsp; Bilkins never wrote about it, never
pointed out anything to be seen in it, never measured anything in
it, always left it alone.&nbsp; For which relief, Heaven bless
the town and the memory of the immortal Bilkins likewise!</p>
<p>There is a charming walk, arched and shaded by trees, on the
old walls that form the four sides of this High Town, whence you
get glimpses of the streets below, and changing views of the
other town and of the river, and of the hills and of the
sea.&nbsp; It is made more agreeable and peculiar by some of the
solemn houses that are rooted in the deep streets below, bursting
into a fresher existence a-top, and having doors and windows, and
even gardens, on these ramparts.&nbsp; A child going in at the
courtyard gate of one of these houses, climbing up the many
stairs, and coming out at the fourth-floor window, might conceive
himself another Jack, alighting on enchanted ground from another
bean-stalk.&nbsp; It is a place wonderfully populous in children;
English children, with governesses reading novels as they walk
down the shady lanes of trees, or nursemaids interchanging gossip
on the seats; French children with their smiling bonnes in
snow-white caps, and themselves&mdash;if little boys&mdash;in
straw head-gear like bee-hives, work-baskets and church
hassocks.&nbsp; Three years ago, there were three weazen old men,
one bearing a frayed red ribbon in his threadbare button-hole,
always to be found walking together among these children, before
dinner-time.&nbsp; If they walked for an appetite, they doubtless
lived en pension&mdash;were contracted for&mdash;otherwise their
poverty would have made it a rash action.&nbsp; They were
stooping, blear-eyed, dull old men, slip-shod and shabby, in
long-skirted short-waisted coats and meagre trousers, and yet
with a ghost of gentility hovering in their company.&nbsp; They
spoke little to each other, and looked as if they might have been
politically discontented if they had had vitality enough.&nbsp;
Once, we overheard red-ribbon feebly complain to the other two
that somebody, or something, was &lsquo;a Robber;&rsquo; and then
they all three set their mouths so that they would have ground
their teeth if they had had any.&nbsp; The ensuing winter
gathered red-ribbon unto the great company of faded ribbons, and
next year the remaining two were there&mdash;getting themselves
entangled with hoops and dolls&mdash;familiar mysteries to the
children&mdash;probably in the eyes of most of them, harmless
creatures who had never been like children, and whom children
could never be like.&nbsp; Another winter came, and another old
man went, and so, this present year, the last of the triumvirate,
left off walking&mdash;it was no good, now&mdash;and sat by
himself on a little solitary bench, with the hoops and the dolls
as lively as ever all about him.</p>
<p>In the Place d&rsquo;Armes of this town, a little decayed
market is held, which seems to slip through the old gateway, like
water, and go rippling down the hill, to mingle with the
murmuring market in the lower town, and get lost in its movement
and bustle.&nbsp; It is very agreeable on an idle summer morning
to pursue this market-stream from the hill-top.&nbsp; It begins,
dozingly and dully, with a few sacks of corn; starts into a
surprising collection of boots and shoes; goes brawling down the
hill in a diversified channel of old cordage, old iron, old
crockery, old clothes, civil and military, old rags, new cotton
goods, flaming prints of saints, little looking-glasses, and
incalculable lengths of tape; dives into a backway, keeping out
of sight for a little while, as streams will, or only sparkling
for a moment in the shape of a market drinking-shop; and suddenly
reappears behind the great church, shooting itself into a bright
confusion of white-capped women and blue-bloused men, poultry,
vegetables, fruits, flowers, pots, pans, praying-chairs,
soldiers, country butter, umbrellas and other sun-shades,
girl-porters waiting to be hired with baskets at their backs, and
one weazen little old man in a cocked hat, wearing a cuirass of
drinking-glasses and carrying on his shoulder a crimson temple
fluttering with flags, like a glorified pavior&rsquo;s rammer
without the handle, who rings a little bell in all parts of the
scene, and cries his cooling drink Hola, Hola, Ho-o-o! in a
shrill cracked voice that somehow makes itself heard, above all
the chaffering and vending hum.&nbsp; Early in the afternoon, the
whole course of the stream is dry.&nbsp; The praying-chairs are
put back in the church, the umbrellas are folded up, the unsold
goods are carried away, the stalls and stands disappear, the
square is swept, the hackney coaches lounge there to be hired,
and on all the country roads (if you walk about, as much as we
do) you will see the peasant women, always neatly and comfortably
dressed, riding home, with the pleasantest saddle-furniture of
clean milk-pails, bright butter-kegs, and the like, on the
jolliest little donkeys in the world.</p>
<p>We have another market in our French watering-place&mdash;that
is to say, a few wooden hutches in the open street, down by the
Port&mdash;devoted to fish.&nbsp; Our fishing-boats are famous
everywhere; and our fishing people, though they love lively
colours, and taste is neutral (see Bilkins), are among the most
picturesque people we ever encountered.&nbsp; They have not only
a quarter of their own in the town itself, but they occupy whole
villages of their own on the neighbouring cliffs.&nbsp; Their
churches and chapels are their own; they consort with one
another, they intermarry among themselves, their customs are
their own, and their costume is their own and never
changes.&nbsp; As soon as one of their boys can walk, he is
provided with a long bright red nightcap; and one of their men
would as soon think of going afloat without his head, as without
that indispensable appendage to it.&nbsp; Then, they wear the
noblest boots, with the hugest tops&mdash;flapping and bulging
over anyhow; above which, they encase themselves in such
wonderful overalls and petticoat trousers, made to all appearance
of tarry old sails, so additionally stiffened with pitch and
salt, that the wearers have a walk of their own, and go
straddling and swinging about among the boats and barrels and
nets and rigging, a sight to see.&nbsp; Then, their younger
women, by dint of going down to the sea barefoot, to fling their
baskets into the boats as they come in with the tide, and bespeak
the first fruits of the haul with propitiatory promises to love
and marry that dear fisherman who shall fill that basket like an
Angel, have the finest legs ever carved by Nature in the
brightest mahogany, and they walk like Juno.&nbsp; Their eyes,
too, are so lustrous that their long gold ear-rings turn dull
beside those brilliant neighbours; and when they are dressed,
what with these beauties, and their fine fresh faces, and their
many petticoats&mdash;striped petticoats, red petticoats, blue
petticoats, always clean and smart, and never too long&mdash;and
their home-made stockings, mulberry-coloured, blue, brown,
purple, lilac&mdash;which the older women, taking care of the
Dutch-looking children, sit in all sorts of places knitting,
knitting, knitting from morning to night&mdash;and what with
their little saucy bright blue jackets, knitted too, and fitting
close to their handsome figures; and what with the natural grace
with which they wear the commonest cap, or fold the commonest
handkerchief round their luxuriant hair&mdash;we say, in a word
and out of breath, that taking all these premises into our
consideration, it has never been a matter of the least surprise
to us that we have never once met, in the cornfields, on the
dusty roads, by the breezy windmills, on the plots of short sweet
grass overhanging the sea&mdash;anywhere&mdash;a young fisherman
and fisherwoman of our French watering-place together, but the
arm of that fisherman has invariably been, as a matter of course
and without any absurd attempt to disguise so plain a necessity,
round the neck or waist of that fisherwoman.&nbsp; And we have
had no doubt whatever, standing looking at their uphill streets,
house rising above house, and terrace above terrace, and bright
garments here and there lying sunning on rough stone parapets,
that the pleasant mist on all such objects, caused by their being
seen through the brown nets hung across on poles to dry, is, in
the eyes of every true young fisherman, a mist of love and
beauty, setting off the goddess of his heart.</p>
<p>Moreover it is to be observed that these are an industrious
people, and a domestic people, and an honest people.&nbsp; And
though we are aware that at the bidding of Bilkins it is our duty
to fall down and worship the Neapolitans, we make bold very much
to prefer the fishing people of our French
watering-place&mdash;especially since our last visit to Naples
within these twelvemonths, when we found only four conditions of
men remaining in the whole city: to wit, lazzaroni, priests,
spies, and soldiers, and all of them beggars; the paternal
government having banished all its subjects except the
rascals.</p>
<p>But we can never henceforth separate our French watering-place
from our own landlord of two summers, M. Loyal Devasseur, citizen
and town-councillor.&nbsp; Permit us to have the pleasure of
presenting M. Loyal Devasseur.</p>
<p>His own family name is simply Loyal; but, as he is married,
and as in that part of France a husband always adds to his own
name the family name of his wife, he writes himself Loyal
Devasseur.&nbsp; He owns a compact little estate of some twenty
or thirty acres on a lofty hill-side, and on it he has built two
country houses, which he lets furnished.&nbsp; They are by many
degrees the best houses that are so let near our French
watering-place; we have had the honour of living in both, and can
testify.&nbsp; The entrance-hall of the first we inhabited was
ornamented with a plan of the estate, representing it as about
twice the size of Ireland; insomuch that when we were yet new to
the property (M. Loyal always speaks of it as &lsquo;La
propri&eacute;t&eacute;&rsquo;) we went three miles straight on
end in search of the bridge of Austerlitz&mdash;which we
afterwards found to be immediately outside the window.&nbsp; The
Ch&acirc;teau of the Old Guard, in another part of the grounds,
and, according to the plan, about two leagues from the little
dining-room, we sought in vain for a week, until, happening one
evening to sit upon a bench in the forest (forest in the plan), a
few yards from the house-door, we observed at our feet, in the
ignominious circumstances of being upside down and greenly
rotten, the Old Guard himself: that is to say, the painted effigy
of a member of that distinguished corps, seven feet high, and in
the act of carrying arms, who had had the misfortune to be blown
down in the previous winter.&nbsp; It will be perceived that M.
Loyal is a staunch admirer of the great Napoleon.&nbsp; He is an
old soldier himself&mdash;captain of the National Guard, with a
handsome gold vase on his chimney-piece presented to him by his
company&mdash;and his respect for the memory of the illustrious
general is enthusiastic.&nbsp; Medallions of him, portraits of
him, busts of him, pictures of him, are thickly sprinkled all
over the property.&nbsp; During the first month of our
occupation, it was our affliction to be constantly knocking down
Napoleon: if we touched a shelf in a dark corner, he toppled over
with a crash; and every door we opened, shook him to the
soul.&nbsp; Yet M. Loyal is not a man of mere castles in the air,
or, as he would say, in Spain.&nbsp; He has a specially
practical, contriving, clever, skilful eye and hand.&nbsp; His
houses are delightful.&nbsp; He unites French elegance and
English comfort, in a happy manner quite his own.&nbsp; He has an
extraordinary genius for making tasteful little bedrooms in
angles of his roofs, which an Englishman would as soon think of
turning to any account as he would think of cultivating the
Desert.&nbsp; We have ourself reposed deliciously in an elegant
chamber of M. Loyal&rsquo;s construction, with our head as nearly
in the kitchen chimney-pot as we can conceive it likely for the
head of any gentleman, not by profession a Sweep, to be.&nbsp;
And, into whatsoever strange nook M. Loyal&rsquo;s genius
penetrates, it, in that nook, infallibly constructs a cupboard
and a row of pegs.&nbsp; In either of our houses, we could have
put away the knapsacks and hung up the hats of the whole regiment
of Guides.</p>
<p>Aforetime, M. Loyal was a tradesman in the town.&nbsp; You can
transact business with no present tradesman in the town, and give
your card &lsquo;chez M. Loyal,&rsquo; but a brighter face shines
upon you directly.&nbsp; We doubt if there is, ever was, or ever
will be, a man so universally pleasant in the minds of people as
M. Loyal is in the minds of the citizens of our French
watering-place.&nbsp; They rub their hands and laugh when they
speak of him.&nbsp; Ah, but he is such a good child, such a brave
boy, such a generous spirit, that Monsieur Loyal!&nbsp; It is the
honest truth.&nbsp; M. Loyal&rsquo;s nature is the nature of a
gentleman.&nbsp; He cultivates his ground with his own hands
(assisted by one little labourer, who falls into a fit now and
then); and he digs and delves from morn to eve in prodigious
perspirations&mdash;&lsquo;works always,&rsquo; as he
says&mdash;but, cover him with dust, mud, weeds, water, any
stains you will, you never can cover the gentleman in M.
Loyal.&nbsp; A portly, upright, broad-shouldered, brown-faced
man, whose soldierly bearing gives him the appearance of being
taller than he is, look into the bright eye of M. Loyal, standing
before you in his working-blouse and cap, not particularly well
shaved, and, it may be, very earthy, and you shall discern in M.
Loyal a gentleman whose true politeness is ingrain, and
confirmation of whose word by his bond you would blush to think
of.&nbsp; Not without reason is M. Loyal when he tells that
story, in his own vivacious way, of his travelling to Fulham,
near London, to buy all these hundreds and hundreds of trees you
now see upon the Property, then a bare, bleak hill; and of his
sojourning in Fulham three months; and of his jovial evenings
with the market-gardeners; and of the crowning banquet before his
departure, when the market-gardeners rose as one man, clinked
their glasses all together (as the custom at Fulham is), and
cried, &lsquo;Vive Loyal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>M. Loyal has an agreeable wife, but no family; and he loves to
drill the children of his tenants, or run races with them, or do
anything with them, or for them, that is good-natured.&nbsp; He
is of a highly convivial temperament, and his hospitality is
unbounded.&nbsp; Billet a soldier on him, and he is
delighted.&nbsp; Five-and-thirty soldiers had M. Loyal billeted
on him this present summer, and they all got fat and red-faced in
two days.&nbsp; It became a legend among the troops that
whosoever got billeted on M. Loyal rolled in clover; and so it
fell out that the fortunate man who drew the billet &lsquo;M.
Loyal Devasseur&rsquo; always leaped into the air, though in
heavy marching order.&nbsp; M. Loyal cannot bear to admit
anything that might seem by any implication to disparage the
military profession.&nbsp; We hinted to him once, that we were
conscious of a remote doubt arising in our mind, whether a sou a
day for pocket-money, tobacco, stockings, drink, washing, and
social pleasures in general, left a very large margin for a
soldier&rsquo;s enjoyment.&nbsp; Pardon! said Monsieur Loyal,
rather wincing.&nbsp; It was not a fortune, but&mdash;&agrave; la
bonne heure&mdash;it was better than it used to be!&nbsp; What,
we asked him on another occasion, were all those neighbouring
peasants, each living with his family in one room, and each
having a soldier (perhaps two) billeted on him every other night,
required to provide for those soldiers?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Faith!&rsquo; said M. Loyal, reluctantly; a bed, monsieur,
and fire to cook with, and a candle.&nbsp; And they share their
supper with those soldiers.&nbsp; It is not possible that they
could eat alone.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And what allowance do they
get for this?&rsquo; said we.&nbsp; Monsieur Loyal drew himself
up taller, took a step back, laid his hand upon his breast, and
said, with majesty, as speaking for himself and all France,
&lsquo;Monsieur, it is a contribution to the State!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is never going to rain, according to M. Loyal.&nbsp; When
it is impossible to deny that it is now raining in torrents, he
says it will be
fine&mdash;charming&mdash;magnificent&mdash;to-morrow.&nbsp; It
is never hot on the Property, he contends.&nbsp; Likewise it is
never cold.&nbsp; The flowers, he says, come out, delighting to
grow there; it is like Paradise this morning; it is like the
Garden of Eden.&nbsp; He is a little fanciful in his language:
smilingly observing of Madame Loyal, when she is absent at
vespers, that she is &lsquo;gone to her
salvation&rsquo;&mdash;all&eacute;e &agrave; son salut.&nbsp; He
has a great enjoyment of tobacco, but nothing would induce him to
continue smoking face to face with a lady.&nbsp; His short black
pipe immediately goes into his breast pocket, scorches his
blouse, and nearly sets him on fire.&nbsp; In the Town Council
and on occasions of ceremony, he appears in a full suit of black,
with a waistcoat of magnificent breadth across the chest, and a
shirt-collar of fabulous proportions.&nbsp; Good M. Loyal!&nbsp;
Under blouse or waistcoat, he carries one of the gentlest hearts
that beat in a nation teeming with gentle people.&nbsp; He has
had losses, and has been at his best under them.&nbsp; Not only
the loss of his way by night in the Fulham times&mdash;when a bad
subject of an Englishman, under pretence of seeing him home, took
him into all the night public-houses, drank
&lsquo;arfanarf&rsquo; in every one at his expense, and finally
fled, leaving him shipwrecked at Cleefeeway, which we apprehend
to be Ratcliffe Highway&mdash;but heavier losses than that.&nbsp;
Long ago a family of children and a mother were left in one of
his houses without money, a whole year.&nbsp; M.
Loyal&mdash;anything but as rich as we wish he had been&mdash;had
not the heart to say &lsquo;you must go;&rsquo; so they stayed on
and stayed on, and paying-tenants who would have come in
couldn&rsquo;t come in, and at last they managed to get helped
home across the water; and M. Loyal kissed the whole group, and
said, &lsquo;Adieu, my poor infants!&rsquo; and sat down in their
deserted salon and smoked his pipe of peace.&mdash;&lsquo;The
rent, M. Loyal?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Eh! well!&nbsp; The
rent!&rsquo;&nbsp; M. Loyal shakes his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Le bon
Dieu,&rsquo; says M. Loyal presently, &lsquo;will recompense
me,&rsquo; and he laughs and smokes his pipe of peace.&nbsp; May
he smoke it on the Property, and not be recompensed, these fifty
years!</p>
<p>There are public amusements in our French watering-place, or
it would not be French.&nbsp; They are very popular, and very
cheap.&nbsp; The sea-bathing&mdash;which may rank as the most
favoured daylight entertainment, inasmuch as the French visitors
bathe all day long, and seldom appear to think of remaining less
than an hour at a time in the water&mdash;is astoundingly
cheap.&nbsp; Omnibuses convey you, if you please, from a
convenient part of the town to the beach and back again; you have
a clean and comfortable bathing-machine, dress, linen, and all
appliances; and the charge for the whole is half-a-franc, or
fivepence.&nbsp; On the pier, there is usually a guitar, which
seems presumptuously enough to set its tinkling against the deep
hoarseness of the sea, and there is always some boy or woman who
sings, without any voice, little songs without any tune: the
strain we have most frequently heard being an appeal to
&lsquo;the sportsman&rsquo; not to bag that choicest of game, the
swallow.&nbsp; For bathing purposes, we have also a subscription
establishment with an esplanade, where people lounge about with
telescopes, and seem to get a good deal of weariness for their
money; and we have also an association of individual machine
proprietors combined against this formidable rival.&nbsp; M.
F&eacute;roce, our own particular friend in the bathing line, is
one of these.&nbsp; How he ever came by his name we cannot
imagine.&nbsp; He is as gentle and polite a man as M. Loyal
Devasseur himself; immensely stout withal; and of a beaming
aspect.&nbsp; M. F&eacute;roce has saved so many people from
drowning, and has been decorated with so many medals in
consequence, that his stoutness seems a special dispensation of
Providence to enable him to wear them; if his girth were the
girth of an ordinary man, he could never hang them on, all at
once.&nbsp; It is only on very great occasions that M.
F&eacute;roce displays his shining honours.&nbsp; At other times
they lie by, with rolls of manuscript testifying to the causes of
their presentation, in a huge glass case in the red-sofa&rsquo;d
salon of his private residence on the beach, where M.
F&eacute;roce also keeps his family pictures, his portraits of
himself as he appears both in bathing life and in private life,
his little boats that rock by clockwork, and his other ornamental
possessions.</p>
<p>Then, we have a commodious and gay Theatre&mdash;or had, for
it is burned down now&mdash;where the opera was always preceded
by a vaudeville, in which (as usual) everybody, down to the
little old man with the large hat and the little cane and tassel,
who always played either my Uncle or my Papa, suddenly broke out
of the dialogue into the mildest vocal snatches, to the great
perplexity of unaccustomed strangers from Great Britain, who
never could make out when they were singing and when they were
talking&mdash;and indeed it was pretty much the same.&nbsp; But,
the caterers in the way of entertainment to whom we are most
beholden, are the Society of Welldoing, who are active all the
summer, and give the proceeds of their good works to the
poor.&nbsp; Some of the most agreeable f&ecirc;tes they contrive,
are announced as &lsquo;Dedicated to the children;&rsquo; and the
taste with which they turn a small public enclosure into an
elegant garden beautifully illuminated; and the thorough-going
heartiness and energy with which they personally direct the
childish pleasures; are supremely delightful.&nbsp; For fivepence
a head, we have on these occasions donkey races with English
&lsquo;Jokeis,&rsquo; and other rustic sports; lotteries for
toys; roundabouts, dancing on the grass to the music of an
admirable band, fire-balloons and fireworks.&nbsp; Further,
almost every week all through the summer&mdash;never mind, now,
on what day of the week&mdash;there is a f&ecirc;te in some
adjoining village (called in that part of the country a Ducasse),
where the people&mdash;really the people&mdash;dance on the green
turf in the open air, round a little orchestra, that seems itself
to dance, there is such an airy motion of flags and streamers all
about it.&nbsp; And we do not suppose that between the Torrid
Zone and the North Pole there are to be found male dancers with
such astonishingly loose legs, furnished with so many joints in
wrong places, utterly unknown to Professor Owen, as those who
here disport themselves.&nbsp; Sometimes, the f&ecirc;te
appertains to a particular trade; you will see among the cheerful
young women at the joint Ducasse of the milliners and tailors, a
wholesome knowledge of the art of making common and cheap things
uncommon and pretty, by good sense and good taste, that is a
practical lesson to any rank of society in a whole island we
could mention.&nbsp; The oddest feature of these agreeable scenes
is the everlasting Roundabout (we preserve an English word
wherever we can, as we are writing the English language), on the
wooden horses of which machine grown-up people of all ages are
wound round and round with the utmost solemnity, while the
proprietor&rsquo;s wife grinds an organ, capable of only one
tune, in the centre.</p>
<p>As to the boarding-houses of our French watering-place, they
are Legion, and would require a distinct treatise.&nbsp; It is
not without a sentiment of national pride that we believe them to
contain more bores from the shores of Albion than all the clubs
in London.&nbsp; As you walk timidly in their neighbourhood, the
very neckcloths and hats of your elderly compatriots cry to you
from the stones of the streets, &lsquo;We are Bores&mdash;avoid
us!&rsquo;&nbsp; We have never overheard at street corners such
lunatic scraps of political and social discussion as among these
dear countrymen of ours.&nbsp; They believe everything that is
impossible and nothing that is true.&nbsp; They carry rumours,
and ask questions, and make corrections and improvements on one
another, staggering to the human intellect.&nbsp; And they are
for ever rushing into the English library, propounding such
incomprehensible paradoxes to the fair mistress of that
establishment, that we beg to recommend her to her
Majesty&rsquo;s gracious consideration as a fit object for a
pension.</p>
<p>The English form a considerable part of the population of our
French watering-place, and are deservedly addressed and respected
in many ways.&nbsp; Some of the surface-addresses to them are odd
enough, as when a laundress puts a placard outside her house
announcing her possession of that curious British instrument, a
&lsquo;Mingle;&rsquo; or when a tavern-keeper provides
accommodation for the celebrated English game of
&lsquo;Nokemdon.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, to us, it is not the least
pleasant feature of our French watering-place that a long and
constant fusion of the two great nations there, has taught each
to like the other, and to learn from the other, and to rise
superior to the absurd prejudices that have lingered among the
weak and ignorant in both countries equally.</p>
<p>Drumming and trumpeting of course go on for ever in our French
watering-place.&nbsp; Flag-flying is at a premium, too; but, we
cheerfully avow that we consider a flag a very pretty object, and
that we take such outward signs of innocent liveliness to our
heart of hearts.&nbsp; The people, in the town and in the
country, are a busy people who work hard; they are sober,
temperate, good-humoured, light-hearted, and generally remarkable
for their engaging manners.&nbsp; Few just men, not immoderately
bilious, could see them in their recreations without very much
respecting the character that is so easily, so harmlessly, and so
simply, pleased.</p>

346</span>BILL-STICKING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> I had an enemy whom I
hated&mdash;which Heaven forbid!&mdash;and if I knew of something
which sat heavy on his conscience, I think I would introduce that
something into a Posting-Bill, and place a large impression in
the hands of an active sticker.&nbsp; I can scarcely imagine a
more terrible revenge.&nbsp; I should haunt him, by this means,
night and day.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that I would publish
his secret, in red letters two feet high, for all the town to
read: I would darkly refer to it.&nbsp; It should be between him,
and me, and the Posting-Bill.&nbsp; Say, for example, that, at a
certain period of his life, my enemy had surreptitiously
possessed himself of a key.&nbsp; I would then embark my capital
in the lock business, and conduct that business on the
advertising principle.&nbsp; In all my placards and
advertisements, I would throw up the line <span
class="smcap">Secret Keys</span>.&nbsp; Thus, if my enemy passed
an uninhabited house, he would see his conscience glaring down on
him from the parapets, and peeping up at him from the
cellars.&nbsp; If he took a dead wall in his walk, it would be
alive with reproaches.&nbsp; If he sought refuge in an omnibus,
the panels thereof would become Belshazzar&rsquo;s palace to
him.&nbsp; If he took boat, in a wild endeavour to escape, he
would see the fatal words lurking under the arches of the bridges
over the Thames.&nbsp; If he walked the streets with downcast
eyes, he would recoil from the very stones of the pavement, made
eloquent by lamp-black lithograph.&nbsp; If he drove or rode, his
way would be blocked up by enormous vans, each proclaiming the
same words over and over again from its whole extent of
surface.&nbsp; Until, having gradually grown thinner and paler,
and having at last totally rejected food, he would miserably
perish, and I should be revenged.&nbsp; This conclusion I should,
no doubt, celebrate by laughing a hoarse laugh in three
syllables, and folding my arms tight upon my chest agreeably to
most of the examples of glutted animosity that I have had an
opportunity of observing in connexion with the Drama&mdash;which,
by-the-by, as involving a good deal of noise, appears to me to be
occasionally confounded with the Drummer.</p>
<p>The foregoing reflections presented themselves to my mind, the
other day, as I contemplated (being newly come to London from the
East Riding of Yorkshire, on a house-hunting expedition for next
May), an old warehouse which rotting paste and rotting paper had
brought down to the condition of an old cheese.&nbsp; It would
have been impossible to say, on the most conscientious survey,
how much of its front was brick and mortar, and how much decaying
and decayed plaster.&nbsp; It was so thickly encrusted with
fragments of bills, that no ship&rsquo;s keel after a long voyage
could be half so foul.&nbsp; All traces of the broken windows
were billed out, the doors were billed across, the water-spout
was billed over.&nbsp; The building was shored up to prevent its
tumbling into the street; and the very beams erected against it
were less wood than paste and paper, they had been so continually
posted and reposted.&nbsp; The forlorn dregs of old posters so
encumbered this wreck, that there was no hold for new posters,
and the stickers had abandoned the place in despair, except one
enterprising man who had hoisted the last masquerade to a clear
spot near the level of the stack of chimneys where it waved and
drooped like a shattered flag.&nbsp; Below the rusty
cellar-grating, crumpled remnants of old bills torn down, rotted
away in wasting heaps of fallen leaves.&nbsp; Here and there,
some of the thick rind of the house had peeled off in strips, and
fluttered heavily down, littering the street; but, still, below
these rents and gashes, layers of decomposing posters showed
themselves, as if they were interminable.&nbsp; I thought the
building could never even be pulled down, but in one adhesive
heap of rottenness and poster.&nbsp; As to getting in&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t believe that if the Sleeping Beauty and her Court had
been so billed up, the young Prince could have done it.</p>
<p>Knowing all the posters that were yet legible, intimately, and
pondering on their ubiquitous nature, I was led into the
reflections with which I began this paper, by considering what an
awful thing it would be, ever to have wronged&mdash;say M. <span
class="smcap">Jullien</span> for example&mdash;and to have his
avenging name in characters of fire incessantly before my
eyes.&nbsp; Or to have injured <span class="smcap">Madame
Tussaud</span>, and undergo a similar retribution.&nbsp; Has any
man a self-reproachful thought associated with pills, or
ointment?&nbsp; What an avenging spirit to that man is <span
class="smcap">Professor Holloway</span>!&nbsp; Have I sinned in
oil?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Cabburn</span> pursues me.&nbsp;
Have I a dark remembrance associated with any gentlemanly

class="smcap">Moses</span> and <span class="smcap">Son</span> are
on my track.&nbsp; Did I ever aim a blow at a defenceless
fellow-creature&rsquo;s head?&nbsp; That head eternally being
measured for a wig, or that worse head which was bald before it
used the balsam, and hirsute afterwards&mdash;enforcing the
benevolent moral, &lsquo;Better to be bald as a Dutch cheese than
come to this,&rsquo;&mdash;undoes me.&nbsp; Have I no sore places
in my mind which <span class="smcap">Mechi</span>
touches&mdash;which <span class="smcap">Nicoll</span>
probes&mdash;which no registered article whatever
lacerates?&nbsp; Does no discordant note within me thrill
responsive to mysterious watchwords, as &lsquo;Revalenta
Arabica,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Number One St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard&rsquo;?&nbsp; Then may I enjoy life, and be happy.</p>
<p>Lifting up my eyes, as I was musing to this effect, I beheld
advancing towards me (I was then on Cornhill, near to the Royal
Exchange), a solemn procession of three advertising vans, of
first-class dimensions, each drawn by a very little horse.&nbsp;
As the cavalcade approached, I was at a loss to reconcile the
careless deportment of the drivers of these vehicles, with the
terrific announcements they conducted through the city, which
being a summary of the contents of a Sunday newspaper, were of
the most thrilling kind.&nbsp; Robbery, fire, murder, and the
ruin of the United Kingdom&mdash;each discharged in a line by
itself, like a separate broad-side of red-hot shot&mdash;were
among the least of the warnings addressed to an unthinking
people.&nbsp; Yet, the Ministers of Fate who drove the awful
cars, leaned forward with their arms upon their knees in a state
of extreme lassitude, for want of any subject of interest.&nbsp;
The first man, whose hair I might naturally have expected to see
standing on end, scratched his head&mdash;one of the smoothest I
ever beheld&mdash;with profound indifference.&nbsp; The second
whistled.&nbsp; The third yawned.</p>
<p>Pausing to dwell upon this apathy, it appeared to me, as the
fatal cars came by me, that I descried in the second car, through
the portal in which the charioteer was seated, a figure stretched
upon the floor.&nbsp; At the same time, I thought I smelt
tobacco.&nbsp; The latter impression passed quickly from me; the
former remained.&nbsp; Curious to know whether this prostrate
figure was the one impressible man of the whole capital who had
been stricken insensible by the terrors revealed to him, and
whose form had been placed in the car by the charioteer, from
motives of humanity, I followed the procession.&nbsp; It turned
into Leadenhall-market, and halted at a public-house.&nbsp; Each
driver dismounted.&nbsp; I then distinctly heard, proceeding from
the second car, where I had dimly seen the prostrate form, the
words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a pipe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The driver entering the public-house with his fellows,
apparently for purposes of refreshment, I could not refrain from
mounting on the shaft of the second vehicle, and looking in at
the portal.&nbsp; I then beheld, reclining on his back upon the
floor, on a kind of mattress or divan, a little man in a
shooting-coat.&nbsp; The exclamation &lsquo;Dear me&rsquo; which
irresistibly escaped my lips caused him to sit upright, and
survey me.&nbsp; I found him to be a good-looking little man of
about fifty, with a shining face, a tight head, a bright eye, a
moist wink, a quick speech, and a ready air.&nbsp; He had
something of a sporting way with him.</p>
<p>He looked at me, and I looked at him, until the driver
displaced me by handing in a pint of beer, a pipe, and what I
understand is called &lsquo;a screw&rsquo; of tobacco&mdash;an
object which has the appearance of a curl-paper taken off the
barmaid&rsquo;s head, with the curl in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said I, when the removed
person of the driver again admitted of my presenting my face at
the portal.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&mdash;excuse my curiosity, which I
inherit from my mother&mdash;do you live here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good, too!&rsquo; returned the little man,
composedly laying aside a pipe he had smoked out, and filling the
pipe just brought to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> live here then?&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>He shook his head, as he calmly lighted his pipe by means of a
German tinder-box, and replied, &lsquo;This is my carriage.&nbsp;
When things are flat, I take a ride sometimes, and enjoy
myself.&nbsp; I am the inventor of these wans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His pipe was now alight.&nbsp; He drank his beer all at once,
and he smoked and he smiled at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a great idea!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so bad,&rsquo; returned the little man, with the
modesty of merit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Might I be permitted to inscribe your name upon the
tablets of my memory?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not much odds in the name,&rsquo;
returned the little man, &lsquo;&mdash;no name particular&mdash;I
am the King of the Bill-Stickers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>The monarch informed me, with a smile, that he had never been
crowned or installed with any public ceremonies, but that he was
peaceably acknowledged as King of the Bill-Stickers in right of
being the oldest and most respected member of &lsquo;the old
school of bill-sticking.&rsquo;&nbsp; He likewise gave me to
understand that there was a Lord Mayor of the Bill-Stickers,
whose genius was chiefly exercised within the limits of the
city.&nbsp; He made some allusion, also, to an inferior
potentate, called &lsquo;Turkey-legs;&rsquo; but I did not
understand that this gentleman was invested with much
power.&nbsp; I rather inferred that he derived his title from
some peculiarity of gait, and that it was of an honorary
character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father,&rsquo; pursued the King of the
Bill-Stickers, &lsquo;was Engineer, Beadle, and Bill-Sticker to
the parish of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Holborn, in the year one
thousand seven hundred and eighty.&nbsp; My father stuck bills at
the time of the riots of London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be acquainted with the whole subject of
bill-sticking, from that time to the present!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty well so,&rsquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but I am a sort of
collector&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Not Income-tax?&rsquo; cried His Majesty,
hastily removing his pipe from his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Water-rate?&rsquo; said His Majesty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gas?&nbsp; Assessed?&nbsp; Sewers?&rsquo; said His
Majesty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You misunderstand me,&rsquo; I replied,
soothingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not that sort of collector at all: a
collector of facts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s only facts,&rsquo; cried the King of
the Bill-Stickers, recovering his good-humour, and banishing the
great mistrust that had suddenly fallen upon him, &lsquo;come in
and welcome!&nbsp; If it had been income, or winders, I think I
should have pitched you out of the wan, upon my soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Readily complying with the invitation, I squeezed myself in at
the small aperture.&nbsp; His Majesty, graciously handing me a
little three-legged stool on which I took my seat in a corner,
inquired if I smoked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do;&mdash;that is, I can,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pipe and a screw!&rsquo; said His Majesty to the
attendant charioteer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you prefer a dry smoke, or
do you moisten it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As unmitigated tobacco produces most disturbing effects upon
my system (indeed, if I had perfect moral courage, I doubt if I
should smoke at all, under any circumstances), I advocated
moisture, and begged the Sovereign of the Bill-Stickers to name
his usual liquor, and to concede to me the privilege of paying
for it.&nbsp; After some delicate reluctance on his part, we were
provided, through the instrumentality of the attendant
charioteer, with a can of cold rum-and-water, flavoured with
sugar and lemon.&nbsp; We were also furnished with a tumbler, and
I was provided with a pipe.&nbsp; His Majesty, then observing
that we might combine business with conversation, gave the word
for the car to proceed; and, to my great delight, we jogged away
at a foot pace.</p>
<p>I say to my great delight, because I am very fond of novelty,
and it was a new sensation to be jolting through the tumult of
the city in that secluded Temple, partly open to the sky,
surrounded by the roar without, and seeing nothing but the
clouds.&nbsp; Occasionally, blows from whips fell heavily on the
Temple&rsquo;s walls, when by stopping up the road longer than
usual, we irritated carters and coachmen to madness; but they
fell harmless upon us within and disturbed not the serenity of
our peaceful retreat.&nbsp; As I looked upward, I felt, I should
imagine, like the Astronomer Royal.&nbsp; I was enchanted by the
contrast between the freezing nature of our external mission on
the blood of the populace, and the perfect composure reigning
within those sacred precincts: where His Majesty, reclining
easily on his left arm, smoked his pipe and drank his
rum-and-water from his own side of the tumbler, which stood
impartially between us.&nbsp; As I looked down from the clouds
and caught his royal eye, he understood my reflections.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have an idea,&rsquo; he observed, with an upward glance,
&lsquo;of training scarlet runners across in the
season,&mdash;making a arbour of it,&mdash;and sometimes taking
tea in the same, according to the song.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I nodded approval.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here you repose and think?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And think,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;of
posters&mdash;walls&mdash;and hoardings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We were both silent, contemplating the vastness of the
subject.&nbsp; I remembered a surprising fancy of dear <span
class="smcap">Thomas Hood&rsquo;s</span>, and wondered whether
this monarch ever sighed to repair to the great wall of China,
and stick bills all over it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so,&rsquo; said he, rousing himself,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s facts as you collect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Facts,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The facts of bill-sticking,&rsquo; pursued His Majesty,
in a benignant manner, &lsquo;as known to myself, air as
following.&nbsp; When my father was Engineer, Beadle, and
Bill-Sticker to the parish of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Holborn, he
employed women to post bills for him.&nbsp; He employed women to
post bills at the time of the riots of London.&nbsp; He died at
the age of seventy-five year, and was buried by the murdered
Eliza Grimwood, over in the Waterloo Road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As this was somewhat in the nature of a royal speech, I
listened with deference and silently.&nbsp; His Majesty, taking a
scroll from his pocket, proceeded, with great distinctness, to
pour out the following flood of information:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The bills being at that period mostly
proclamations and declarations, and which were only a demy size,
the manner of posting the bills (as they did not use brushes) was
by means of a piece of wood which they called a
&lsquo;dabber.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus things continued till such time
as the State Lottery was passed, and then the printers began to
print larger bills, and men were employed instead of women, as
the State Lottery Commissioners then began to send men all over
England to post bills, and would keep them out for six or eight
months at a time, and they were called by the London
bill-stickers &lsquo;trampers,&rsquo; their wages at the time
being ten shillings per day, besides expenses.&nbsp; They used
sometimes to be stationed in large towns for five or six months
together, distributing the schemes to all the houses in the
town.&nbsp; And then there were more caricature wood-block
engravings for posting-bills than there are at the present time,
the principal printers, at that time, of posting-bills being
Messrs. Evans and Ruffy, of Budge Row; Thoroughgood and Whiting,
of the present day; and Messrs. Gye and Balne, Gracechurch
Street, City.&nbsp; The largest bills printed at that period were
a two-sheet double crown; and when they commenced printing
four-sheet bills, two bill-stickers would work together.&nbsp;
They had no settled wages per week, but had a fixed price for
their work, and the London bill-stickers, during a lottery week,
have been known to earn, each, eight or nine pounds per week,
till the day of drawing; likewise the men who carried boards in
the street used to have one pound per week, and the bill-stickers
at that time would not allow any one to wilfully cover or destroy
their bills, as they had a society amongst themselves, and very
frequently dined together at some public-house where they used to
go of an evening to have their work delivered out untoe
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this His Majesty delivered in a gallant manner; posting
it, as it were, before me, in a great proclamation.&nbsp; I took
advantage of the pause he now made, to inquire what a
&lsquo;two-sheet double crown&rsquo; might express?</p>
<p>&lsquo;A two-sheet double crown,&rsquo; replied the King,
&lsquo;is a bill thirty-nine inches wide by thirty inches
high.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it possible,&rsquo; said I, my mind reverting to the
gigantic admonitions we were then displaying to the
multitude&mdash;which were as infants to some of the
posting-bills on the rotten old warehouse&mdash;&lsquo;that some
few years ago the largest bill was no larger than
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact,&rsquo; returned the King, &lsquo;is
undoubtedly so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he instantly rushed again into
the scroll.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Since the abolishing of the State Lottery all
that good feeling has gone, and nothing but jealousy exists,
through the rivalry of each other.&nbsp; Several bill-sticking
companies have started, but have failed.&nbsp; The first party
that started a company was twelve year ago; but what was left of
the old school and their dependants joined together and opposed
them.&nbsp; And for some time we were quiet again, till a printer
of Hatton Garden formed a company by hiring the sides of houses;
but he was not supported by the public, and he left his wooden
frames fixed up for rent.&nbsp; The last company that started,
took advantage of the New Police Act, and hired of Messrs.
Grissell and Peto the hoarding of Trafalgar Square, and
established a bill-sticking office in Cursitor Street, Chancery
Lane, and engaged some of the new bill-stickers to do their work,
and for a time got the half of all our work, and with such spirit
did they carry on their opposition towards us, that they used to
give us in charge before the magistrate, and get us fined; but
they found it so expensive, that they could not keep it up, for
they were always employing a lot of ruffians from the Seven Dials
to come and fight us; and on one occasion the old bill-stickers
went to Trafalgar Square to attempt to post bills, when they were
given in custody by the watchman in their employ, and fined at
Queen Square five pounds, as they would not allow any of us to
speak in the office; but when they were gone, we had an interview
with the magistrate, who mitigated the fine to fifteen
shillings.&nbsp; During the time the men were waiting for the
fine, this company started off to a public-house that we were in
the habit of using, and waited for us coming back, where a
fighting scene took place that beggars description.&nbsp; Shortly
after this, the principal one day came and shook hands with us,
and acknowledged that he had broken up the company, and that he
himself had lost five hundred pound in trying to overthrow
us.&nbsp; We then took possession of the hoarding in Trafalgar
Square; but Messrs. Grissell and Peto would not allow us to post
our bills on the said hoarding without paying them&mdash;and from
first to last we paid upwards of two hundred pounds for that
hoarding, and likewise the hoarding of the Reform Club-house,
Pall Mall.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>His Majesty, being now completely out of breath, laid down his
scroll (which he appeared to have finished), puffed at his pipe,
and took some rum-and-water.&nbsp; I embraced the opportunity of
asking how many divisions the art and mystery of bill-sticking
comprised?&nbsp; He replied, three&mdash;auctioneers&rsquo;
bill-sticking, theatrical bill-sticking, general
bill-sticking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The auctioneers&rsquo; porters,&rsquo; said the King,
&lsquo;who do their bill-sticking, are mostly respectable and
intelligent, and generally well paid for their work, whether in
town or country.&nbsp; The price paid by the principal
auctioneers for country work is nine shillings per day; that is,
seven shillings for day&rsquo;s work, one shilling for lodging,
and one for paste.&nbsp; Town work is five shillings a day,
including paste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Town work must be rather hot work,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;if there be many of those fighting scenes that beggar
description, among the bill-stickers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the King, &lsquo;I an&rsquo;t a
stranger, I assure you, to black eyes; a bill-sticker ought to
know how to handle his fists a bit.&nbsp; As to that row I have
mentioned, that grew out of competition, conducted in an
uncompromising spirit.&nbsp; Besides a man in a horse-and-shay
continually following us about, the company had a watchman on
duty, night and day, to prevent us sticking bills upon the
hoarding in Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; We went there, early one
morning, to stick bills and to black-wash their bills if we were
interfered with.&nbsp; We were interfered with, and I gave the
word for laying on the wash.&nbsp; It was laid on&mdash;pretty
brisk&mdash;and we were all taken to Queen Square: but they
couldn&rsquo;t fine me.&nbsp; I knew that,&rsquo;&mdash;with a
bright smile&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d only give directions&mdash;I
was only the General.&rsquo;&nbsp; Charmed with this
monarch&rsquo;s affability, I inquired if he had ever hired a
hoarding himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hired a large one,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;opposite
the Lyceum Theatre, when the buildings was there.&nbsp; Paid
thirty pound for it; let out places on it, and called it
&ldquo;The External Paper-Hanging Station.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it
didn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp; Ah!&rsquo; said His Majesty
thoughtfully, as he filled the glass, &lsquo;Bill-stickers have a
deal to contend with.&nbsp; The bill-sticking clause was got into
the Police Act by a member of Parliament that employed me at his
election.&nbsp; The clause is pretty stiff respecting where bills
go; but he didn&rsquo;t mind where his bills went.&nbsp; It was
all right enough, so long as they was his bills!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fearful that I observed a shadow of misanthropy on the
King&rsquo;s cheerful face, I asked whose ingenious invention
that was, which I greatly admired, of sticking bills under the
arches of the bridges.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine!&rsquo; said His Majesty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was the
first that ever stuck a bill under a bridge!&nbsp; Imitators soon
rose up, of course.&mdash;When don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; But they
stuck &rsquo;em at low-water, and the tide came and swept the
bills clean away.&nbsp; I knew that!&rsquo;&nbsp; The King
laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What may be the name of that instrument, like an
immense fishing-rod,&rsquo; I inquired, &lsquo;with which bills
are posted on high places?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The joints,&rsquo; returned His Majesty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, we use the joints where formerly we used
ladders&mdash;as they do still in country places.&nbsp; Once,
when Madame&rsquo; (Vestris, understood) &lsquo;was playing in
Liverpool, another bill-sticker and me were at it together on the
wall outside the Clarence Dock&mdash;me with the joints&mdash;him
on a ladder.&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; I had my bill up, right over his
head, yards above him, ladder and all, while he was crawling to
his work.&nbsp; The people going in and out of the docks, stood
and laughed!&mdash;It&rsquo;s about thirty years since the joints
come in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are there any bill-stickers who can&rsquo;t
read?&rsquo; I took the liberty of inquiring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some,&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;But they know
which is the right side up&rsquo;ards of their work.&nbsp; They
keep it as it&rsquo;s given out to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I have seen a
bill or so stuck wrong side up&rsquo;ards.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
very rare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our discourse sustained some interruption at this point, by
the procession of cars occasioning a stoppage of about
three-quarters of a mile in length, as nearly as I could
judge.&nbsp; His Majesty, however, entreating me not to be
discomposed by the contingent uproar, smoked with great
placidity, and surveyed the firmament.</p>
<p>When we were again in motion, I begged to be informed what was
the largest poster His Majesty had ever seen.&nbsp; The King
replied, &lsquo;A thirty-six sheet poster.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
gathered, also, that there were about a hundred and fifty
bill-stickers in London, and that His Majesty considered an
average hand equal to the posting of one hundred bills (single
sheets) in a day.&nbsp; The King was of opinion, that, although
posters had much increased in size, they had not increased in
number; as the abolition of the State Lotteries had occasioned a
great falling off, especially in the country.&nbsp; Over and
above which change, I bethought myself that the custom of
advertising in newspapers had greatly increased.&nbsp; The
completion of many London improvements, as Trafalgar Square (I
particularly observed the singularity of His Majesty&rsquo;s
calling that an improvement), the Royal Exchange, &amp;c., had of
late years reduced the number of advantageous
posting-places.&nbsp; Bill-Stickers at present rather confine
themselves to districts, than to particular descriptions of
work.&nbsp; One man would strike over Whitechapel, another would
take round Houndsditch, Shoreditch, and the City Road; one (the
King said) would stick to the Surrey side; another would make a
beat of the West-end.</p>
<p>His Majesty remarked, with some approach to severity, on the
neglect of delicacy and taste, gradually introduced into the
trade by the new school: a profligate and inferior race of
impostors who took jobs at almost any price, to the detriment of
the old school, and the confusion of their own misguided
employers.&nbsp; He considered that the trade was overdone with
competition, and observed speaking of his subjects, &lsquo;There
are too many of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;&nbsp; He believed, still, that
things were a little better than they had been; adducing, as a
proof, the fact that particular posting places were now reserved,
by common consent, for particular posters; those places, however,
must be regularly occupied by those posters, or, they lapsed and
fell into other hands.&nbsp; It was of no use giving a man a
Drury Lane bill this week and not next.&nbsp; Where was it to
go?&nbsp; He was of opinion that going to the expense of putting
up your own board on which your sticker could display your own
bills, was the only complete way of posting yourself at the
present time; but, even to effect this, on payment of a shilling
a week to the keepers of steamboat piers and other such places,
you must be able, besides, to give orders for theatres and public
exhibitions, or you would be sure to be cut out by
somebody.&nbsp; His Majesty regarded the passion for orders, as
one of the most unappeasable appetites of human nature.&nbsp; If
there were a building, or if there were repairs, going on,
anywhere, you could generally stand something and make it right
with the foreman of the works; but, orders would be expected from
you, and the man who could give the most orders was the man who
would come off best.&nbsp; There was this other objectionable
point, in orders, that workmen sold them for drink, and often
sold them to persons who were likewise troubled with the weakness
of thirst: which led (His Majesty said) to the presentation of
your orders at Theatre doors, by individuals who were &lsquo;too
shakery&rsquo; to derive intellectual profit from the
entertainments, and who brought a scandal on you.&nbsp; Finally,
His Majesty said that you could hardly put too little in a
poster; what you wanted, was, two or three good catch-lines for
the eye to rest on&mdash;then, leave it alone&mdash;and there you
were!</p>
<p>These are the minutes of my conversation with His Majesty, as
I noted them down shortly afterwards.&nbsp; I am not aware that I
have been betrayed into any alteration or suppression.&nbsp; The
manner of the King was frank in the extreme; and he seemed to me
to avoid, at once that slight tendency to repetition which may
have been observed in the conversation of His Majesty King George
the Third, and&mdash;that slight under-current of egotism which
the curious observer may perhaps detect in the conversation of
Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>I must do the King the justice to say that it was I, and not
he, who closed the dialogue.&nbsp; At this juncture, I became the
subject of a remarkable optical delusion; the legs of my stool
appeared to me to double up; the car to spin round and round with
great violence; and a mist to arise between myself and His
Majesty.&nbsp; In addition to these sensations, I felt extremely
unwell.&nbsp; I refer these unpleasant effects, either to the
paste with which the posters were affixed to the van: which may
have contained some small portion of arsenic; or, to the
printer&rsquo;s ink, which may have contained some equally
deleterious ingredient.&nbsp; Of this, I cannot be sure.&nbsp; I
am only sure that I was not affected, either by the smoke, or the
rum-and-water.&nbsp; I was assisted out of the vehicle, in a
state of mind which I have only experienced in two other
places&mdash;I allude to the Pier at Dover, and to the
corresponding portion of the town of Calais&mdash;and sat upon a
door-step until I recovered.&nbsp; The procession had then
disappeared.&nbsp; I have since looked anxiously for the King in
several other cars, but I have not yet had the happiness of
seeing His Majesty.</p>
<h2><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>&lsquo;BIRTHS.&nbsp; MRS. MEEK, OF A SON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> name is Meek.&nbsp; I am, in
fact, Mr. Meek.&nbsp; That son is mine and Mrs.
Meek&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When I saw the announcement in the Times, I
dropped the paper.&nbsp; I had put it in, myself, and paid for
it, but it looked so noble that it overpowered me.</p>
<p>As soon as I could compose my feelings, I took the paper up to
Mrs. Meek&rsquo;s bedside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Maria Jane,&rsquo; said I
(I allude to Mrs. Meek), &lsquo;you are now a public
character.&rsquo;&nbsp; We read the review of our child, several
times, with feelings of the strongest emotion; and I sent the boy
who cleans the boots and shoes, to the office for fifteen
copies.&nbsp; No reduction was made on taking that quantity.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary for me to say, that our child had
been expected.&nbsp; In fact, it had been expected, with
comparative confidence, for some months.&nbsp; Mrs. Meek&rsquo;s
mother, who resides with us&mdash;of the name of Bigby&mdash;had
made every preparation for its admission to our circle.</p>
<p>I hope and believe I am a quiet man.&nbsp; I will go
farther.&nbsp; I know I am a quiet man.&nbsp; My constitution is
tremulous, my voice was never loud, and, in point of stature, I
have been from infancy, small.&nbsp; I have the greatest respect
for Maria Jane&rsquo;s Mama.&nbsp; She is a most remarkable
woman.&nbsp; I honour Maria Jane&rsquo;s Mama.&nbsp; In my
opinion she would storm a town, single-handed, with a
hearth-broom, and carry it.&nbsp; I have never known her to yield
any point whatever, to mortal man.&nbsp; She is calculated to
terrify the stoutest heart.</p>
<p>Still&mdash;but I will not anticipate.</p>
<p>The first intimation I had, of any preparations being in
progress, on the part of Maria Jane&rsquo;s Mama, was one
afternoon, several months ago.&nbsp; I came home earlier than
usual from the office, and, proceeding into the dining-room,
found an obstruction behind the door, which prevented it from
opening freely.&nbsp; It was an obstruction of a soft
nature.&nbsp; On looking in, I found it to be a female.</p>
<p>The female in question stood in the corner behind the door,
consuming Sherry Wine.&nbsp; From the nutty smell of that
beverage pervading the apartment, I have no doubt she was
consuming a second glassful.&nbsp; She wore a black bonnet of
large dimensions, and was copious in figure.&nbsp; The expression
of her countenance was severe and discontented.&nbsp; The words
to which she gave utterance on seeing me, were these, &lsquo;Oh,
git along with you, Sir, if you please; me and Mrs. Bigby
don&rsquo;t want no male parties here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That female was Mrs. Prodgit.</p>
<p>I immediately withdrew, of course.&nbsp; I was rather hurt,
but I made no remark.&nbsp; Whether it was that I showed a
lowness of spirits after dinner, in consequence of feeling that I
seemed to intrude, I cannot say.&nbsp; But, Maria Jane&rsquo;s
Mama said to me on her retiring for the night: in a low distinct
voice, and with a look of reproach that completely subdued me:
&lsquo;George Meek, Mrs. Prodgit is your wife&rsquo;s
nurse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bear no ill-will towards Mrs. Prodgit.&nbsp; Is it likely
that I, writing this with tears in my eyes, should be capable of
deliberate animosity towards a female, so essential to the
welfare of Maria Jane?&nbsp; I am willing to admit that Fate may
have been to blame, and not Mrs. Prodgit; but, it is undeniably
true, that the latter female brought desolation and devastation
into my lowly dwelling.</p>
<p>We were happy after her first appearance; we were sometimes
exceedingly so.&nbsp; But, whenever the parlour door was opened,
and &lsquo;Mrs. Prodgit!&rsquo; announced (and she was very often
announced), misery ensued.&nbsp; I could not bear Mrs.
Prodgit&rsquo;s look.&nbsp; I felt that I was far from wanted,
and had no business to exist in Mrs. Prodgit&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; Between Maria Jane&rsquo;s Mama, and Mrs.
Prodgit, there was a dreadful, secret, understanding&mdash;a dark
mystery and conspiracy, pointing me out as a being to be
shunned.&nbsp; I appeared to have done something that was
evil.&nbsp; Whenever Mrs. Prodgit called, after dinner, I retired
to my dressing-room&mdash;where the temperature is very low
indeed, in the wintry time of the year&mdash;and sat looking at
my frosty breath as it rose before me, and at my rack of boots; a
serviceable article of furniture, but never, in my opinion, an
exhilarating object.&nbsp; The length of the councils that were
held with Mrs. Prodgit, under these circumstances, I will not
attempt to describe.&nbsp; I will merely remark, that Mrs.
Prodgit always consumed Sherry Wine while the deliberations were
in progress; that they always ended in Maria Jane&rsquo;s being
in wretched spirits on the sofa; and that Maria Jane&rsquo;s Mama
always received me, when I was recalled, with a look of desolate
triumph that too plainly said, &lsquo;Now, George Meek!&nbsp; You
see my child, Maria Jane, a ruin, and I hope you are
satisfied!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I pass, generally, over the period that intervened between the
day when Mrs. Prodgit entered her protest against male parties,
and the ever-memorable midnight when I brought her to my
unobtrusive home in a cab, with an extremely large box on the
roof, and a bundle, a bandbox, and a basket, between the
driver&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp; I have no objection to Mrs. Prodgit
(aided and abetted by Mrs. Bigby, who I never can forget is the
parent of Maria Jane) taking entire possession of my unassuming
establishment.&nbsp; In the recesses of my own breast, the
thought may linger that a man in possession cannot be so dreadful
as a woman, and that woman Mrs. Prodgit; but, I ought to bear a
good deal, and I hope I can, and do.&nbsp; Huffing and snubbing,
prey upon my feelings; but, I can bear them without
complaint.&nbsp; They may tell in the long run; I may be hustled
about, from post to pillar, beyond my strength; nevertheless, I
wish to avoid giving rise to words in the family.</p>
<p>The voice of Nature, however, cries aloud in behalf of
Augustus George, my infant son.&nbsp; It is for him that I wish
to utter a few plaintive household words.&nbsp; I am not at all
angry; I am mild&mdash;but miserable.</p>
<p>I wish to know why, when my child, Augustus George, was
expected in our circle, a provision of pins was made, as if the
little stranger were a criminal who was to be put to the torture
immediately, on his arrival, instead of a holy babe?&nbsp; I wish
to know why haste was made to stick those pins all over his
innocent form, in every direction?&nbsp; I wish to be informed
why light and air are excluded from Augustus George, like
poisons?&nbsp; Why, I ask, is my unoffending infant so hedged
into a basket-bedstead, with dimity and calico, with miniature
sheets and blankets, that I can only hear him snuffle (and no
wonder!) deep down under the pink hood of a little
bathing-machine, and can never peruse even so much of his
lineaments as his nose?</p>
<p>Was I expected to be the father of a French Roll, that the
brushes of All Nations were laid in, to rasp Augustus
George?&nbsp; Am I to be told that his sensitive skin was ever
intended by Nature to have rashes brought out upon it, by the
premature and incessant use of those formidable little
instruments?</p>
<p>Is my son a Nutmeg, that he is to be grated on the stiff edges
of sharp frills?&nbsp; Am I the parent of a Muslin boy, that his
yielding surface is to be crimped and small plaited?&nbsp; Or is
my child composed of Paper or of Linen, that impressions of the
finer getting-up art, practised by the laundress, are to be
printed off, all over his soft arms and legs, as I constantly
observe them?&nbsp; The starch enters his soul; who can wonder
that he cries?</p>
<p>Was Augustus George intended to have limbs, or to be born a
Torso?&nbsp; I presume that limbs were the intention, as they are
the usual practice.&nbsp; Then, why are my poor child&rsquo;s
limbs fettered and tied up?&nbsp; Am I to be told that there is
any analogy between Augustus George Meek and Jack Sheppard?</p>
<p>Analyse Castor Oil at any Institution of Chemistry that may be
agreed upon, and inform me what resemblance, in taste, it bears
to that natural provision which it is at once the pride and duty
of Maria Jane to administer to Augustus George!&nbsp; Yet, I
charge Mrs. Prodgit (aided and abetted by Mrs. Bigby) with
systematically forcing Castor Oil on my innocent son, from the
first hour of his birth.&nbsp; When that medicine, in its
efficient action, causes internal disturbance to Augustus George,
I charge Mrs. Prodgit (aided and abetted by Mrs. Bigby) with
insanely and inconsistently administering opium to allay the
storm she has raised!&nbsp; What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>If the days of Egyptian Mummies are past, how dare Mrs.
Prodgit require, for the use of my son, an amount of flannel and
linen that would carpet my humble roof?&nbsp; Do I wonder that
she requires it?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; This morning, within an hour, I
beheld this agonising sight.&nbsp; I beheld my son&mdash;Augustus
George&mdash;in Mrs. Prodgit&rsquo;s hands, and on Mrs.
Prodgit&rsquo;s knee, being dressed.&nbsp; He was at the moment,
comparatively speaking, in a state of nature; having nothing on,
but an extremely short shirt, remarkably disproportionate to the
length of his usual outer garments.&nbsp; Trailing from Mrs.
Prodgit&rsquo;s lap, on the floor, was a long narrow roller or
bandage&mdash;I should say of several yards in extent.&nbsp; In
this, I <span class="GutSmall">SAW</span> Mrs. Prodgit tightly
roll the body of my unoffending infant, turning him over and
over, now presenting his unconscious face upwards, now the back
of his bald head, until the unnatural feat was accomplished, and
the bandage secured by a pin, which I have every reason to
believe entered the body of my only child.&nbsp; In this
tourniquet, he passes the present phase of his existence.&nbsp;
Can I know it, and smile!</p>
<p>I fear I have been betrayed into expressing myself warmly, but
I feel deeply.&nbsp; Not for myself; for Augustus George.&nbsp; I
dare not interfere.&nbsp; Will any one?&nbsp; Will any
publication?&nbsp; Any doctor?&nbsp; Any parent?&nbsp; Any
body?&nbsp; I do not complain that Mrs. Prodgit (aided and
abetted by Mrs. Bigby) entirely alienates Maria Jane&rsquo;s
affections from me, and interposes an impassable barrier between
us.&nbsp; I do not complain of being made of no account.&nbsp; I
do not want to be of any account.&nbsp; But, Augustus George is a
production of Nature (I cannot think otherwise), and I claim that
he should be treated with some remote reference to Nature.&nbsp;
In my opinion, Mrs. Prodgit is, from first to last, a convention
and a superstition.&nbsp; Are all the faculty afraid of Mrs.
Prodgit?&nbsp; If not, why don&rsquo;t they take her in hand and
improve her?</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Maria Jane&rsquo;s Mama boasts of her own knowledge
of the subject, and says she brought up seven children besides
Maria Jane.&nbsp; But how do <i>I</i> know that she might not
have brought them up much better?&nbsp; Maria Jane herself is far
from strong, and is subject to headaches, and nervous
indigestion.&nbsp; Besides which, I learn from the statistical
tables that one child in five dies within the first year of its
life; and one child in three, within the fifth.&nbsp; That
don&rsquo;t look as if we could never improve in these
particulars, I think!</p>
<p>P.P.S. Augustus George is in convulsions.</p>

361</span>LYING AWAKE</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My</span> uncle lay with his eyes
half closed, and his nightcap drawn almost down to his
nose.&nbsp; His fancy was already wandering, and began to mingle
up the present scene with the crater of Vesuvius, the French
Opera, the Coliseum at Rome, Dolly&rsquo;s Chop-house in London,
and all the farrago of noted places with which the brain of a
traveller is crammed; in a word, he was just falling
asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus, that delightful writer, <span class="smcap">Washington
Irving</span>, in his Tales of a Traveller.&nbsp; But, it
happened to me the other night to be lying: not with my eyes half
closed, but with my eyes wide open; not with my nightcap drawn
almost down to my nose, for on sanitary principles I never wear a
nightcap: but with my hair pitchforked and touzled all over the
pillow; not just falling asleep by any means, but glaringly,
persistently, and obstinately, broad awake.&nbsp; Perhaps, with
no scientific intention or invention, I was illustrating the
theory of the Duality of the Brain; perhaps one part of my brain,
being wakeful, sat up to watch the other part which was
sleepy.&nbsp; Be that as it may, something in me was as desirous
to go to sleep as it possibly could be, but something else in me
would not go to sleep, and was as obstinate as George the
Third.</p>
<p>Thinking of George the Third&mdash;for I devote this paper to
my train of thoughts as I lay awake: most people lying awake
sometimes, and having some interest in the subject&mdash;put me
in mind of <span class="smcap">Benjamin Franklin</span>, and so
Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s paper on the art of procuring pleasant
dreams, which would seem necessarily to include the art of going
to sleep, came into my head.&nbsp; Now, as I often used to read
that paper when I was a very small boy, and as I recollect
everything I read then as perfectly as I forget everything I read
now, I quoted &lsquo;Get out of bed, beat up and turn your
pillow, shake the bed-clothes well with at least twenty shakes,
then throw the bed open and leave it to cool; in the meanwhile,
continuing undrest, walk about your chamber.&nbsp; When you begin
to feel the cold air unpleasant, then return to your bed, and you
will soon fall asleep, and your sleep will be sweet and
pleasant.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not a bit of it!&nbsp; I performed the
whole ceremony, and if it were possible for me to be more
saucer-eyed than I was before, that was the only result that came
of it.</p>
<p>Except Niagara.&nbsp; The two quotations from Washington
Irving and Benjamin Franklin may have put it in my head by an
American association of ideas; but there I was, and the
Horse-shoe Fall was thundering and tumbling in my eyes and ears,
and the very rainbows that I left upon the spray when I really
did last look upon it, were beautiful to see.&nbsp; The
night-light being quite as plain, however, and sleep seeming to
be many thousand miles further off than Niagara, I made up my
mind to think a little about Sleep; which I no sooner did than I
whirled off in spite of myself to Drury Lane Theatre, and there
saw a great actor and dear friend of mine (whom I had been
thinking of in the day) playing Macbeth, and heard him
apostrophising &lsquo;the death of each day&rsquo;s life,&rsquo;
as I have heard him many a time, in the days that are gone.</p>
<p>But, Sleep.&nbsp; I will think about Sleep.&nbsp; I am
determined to think (this is the way I went on) about
Sleep.&nbsp; I must hold the word Sleep, tight and fast, or I
shall be off at a tangent in half a second.&nbsp; I feel myself
unaccountably straying, already, into Clare Market.&nbsp;
Sleep.&nbsp; It would be curious, as illustrating the equality of
sleep, to inquire how many of its phenomena are common to all
classes, to all degrees of wealth and poverty, to every grade of
education and ignorance.&nbsp; Here, for example, is her Majesty
Queen Victoria in her palace, this present blessed night, and
here is Winking Charley, a sturdy vagrant, in one of her
Majesty&rsquo;s jails.&nbsp; Her Majesty has fallen, many
thousands of times, from that same Tower, which I claim a right
to tumble off now and then.&nbsp; So has Winking Charley.&nbsp;
Her Majesty in her sleep has opened or prorogued Parliament, or
has held a Drawing Room, attired in some very scanty dress, the
deficiencies and improprieties of which have caused her great
uneasiness.&nbsp; I, in my degree, have suffered unspeakable
agitation of mind from taking the chair at a public dinner at the
London Tavern in my night-clothes, which not all the courtesy of
my kind friend and host <span class="smcap">Mr. Bathe</span>
could persuade me were quite adapted to the occasion.&nbsp;
Winking Charley has been repeatedly tried in a worse
condition.&nbsp; Her Majesty is no stranger to a vault or
firmament, of a sort of floorcloth, with an indistinct pattern
distantly resembling eyes, which occasionally obtrudes itself on
her repose.&nbsp; Neither am I.&nbsp; Neither is Winking
Charley.&nbsp; It is quite common to all three of us to skim
along with airy strides a little above the ground; also to hold,
with the deepest interest, dialogues with various people, all
represented by ourselves; and to be at our wit&rsquo;s end to
know what they are going to tell us; and to be indescribably
astonished by the secrets they disclose.&nbsp; It is probable
that we have all three committed murders and hidden bodies.&nbsp;
It is pretty certain that we have all desperately wanted to cry
out, and have had no voice; that we have all gone to the play and
not been able to get in; that we have all dreamed much more of
our youth than of our later lives; that&mdash;I have lost
it!&nbsp; The thread&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>And up I go.&nbsp; I, lying here with the night-light before
me, up I go, for no reason on earth that I can find out, and
drawn by no links that are visible to me, up the Great Saint
Bernard!&nbsp; I have lived in Switzerland, and rambled among the
mountains; but, why I should go there now, and why up the Great
Saint Bernard in preference to any other mountain, I have no
idea.&nbsp; As I lie here broad awake, and with every sense so
sharpened that I can distinctly hear distant noises inaudible to
me at another time, I make that journey, as I really did, on the
same summer day, with the same happy party&mdash;ah! two since
dead, I grieve to think&mdash;and there is the same track, with
the same black wooden arms to point the way, and there are the
same storm-refuges here and there; and there is the same snow
falling at the top, and there are the same frosty mists, and
there is the same intensely cold convent with its
m&eacute;nagerie smell, and the same breed of dogs fast dying
out, and the same breed of jolly young monks whom I mourn to know
as humbugs, and the same convent parlour with its piano and the
sitting round the fire, and the same supper, and the same lone
night in a cell, and the same bright fresh morning when going out
into the highly rarefied air was like a plunge into an icy
bath.&nbsp; Now, see here what comes along; and why does this
thing stalk into my mind on the top of a Swiss mountain!</p>
<p>It is a figure that I once saw, just after dark, chalked upon
a door in a little back lane near a country church&mdash;my first
church.&nbsp; How young a child I may have been at the time I
don&rsquo;t know, but it horrified me so intensely&mdash;in
connexion with the churchyard, I suppose, for it smokes a pipe,
and has a big hat with each of its ears sticking out in a
horizontal line under the brim, and is not in itself more
oppressive than a mouth from ear to ear, a pair of goggle eyes,
and hands like two bunches of carrots, five in each, can make
it&mdash;that it is still vaguely alarming to me to recall (as I
have often done before, lying awake) the running home, the
looking behind, the horror, of its following me; though whether
disconnected from the door, or door and all, I can&rsquo;t say,
and perhaps never could.&nbsp; It lays a disagreeable
train.&nbsp; I must resolve to think of something on the
voluntary principle.</p>
<p>The balloon ascents of this last season.&nbsp; They will do to
think about, while I lie awake, as well as anything else.&nbsp; I
must hold them tight though, for I feel them sliding away, and in
their stead are the Mannings, husband and wife, hanging on the
top of Horse-monger Lane Jail.&nbsp; In connexion with which
dismal spectacle, I recall this curious fantasy of the
mind.&nbsp; That, having beheld that execution, and having left
those two forms dangling on the top of the entrance
gateway&mdash;the man&rsquo;s, a limp, loose suit of clothes as
if the man had gone out of them; the woman&rsquo;s, a fine shape,
so elaborately corseted and artfully dressed, that it was quite
unchanged in its trim appearance as it slowly swung from side to
side&mdash;I never could, by my uttermost efforts, for some
weeks, present the outside of that prison to myself (which the
terrible impression I had received continually obliged me to do)
without presenting it with the two figures still hanging in the
morning air.&nbsp; Until, strolling past the gloomy place one
night, when the street was deserted and quiet, and actually
seeing that the bodies were not there, my fancy was persuaded, as
it were, to take them down and bury them within the precincts of
the jail, where they have lain ever since.</p>
<p>The balloon ascents of last season.&nbsp; Let me reckon them
up.&nbsp; There were the horse, the bull, the
parachute,&mdash;and the tumbler hanging on&mdash;chiefly by his
toes, I believe&mdash;below the car.&nbsp; Very wrong, indeed,
and decidedly to be stopped.&nbsp; But, in connexion with these
and similar dangerous exhibitions, it strikes me that that
portion of the public whom they entertain, is unjustly
reproached.&nbsp; Their pleasure is in the difficulty
overcome.&nbsp; They are a public of great faith, and are quite
confident that the gentleman will not fall off the horse, or the
lady off the bull or out of the parachute, and that the tumbler
has a firm hold with his toes.&nbsp; They do not go to see the
adventurer vanquished, but triumphant.&nbsp; There is no parallel
in public combats between men and beasts, because nobody can
answer for the particular beast&mdash;unless it were always the
same beast, in which case it would be a mere stage-show, which
the same public would go in the same state of mind to see,
entirely believing in the brute being beforehand safely subdued
by the man.&nbsp; That they are not accustomed to calculate
hazards and dangers with any nicety, we may know from their rash
exposure of themselves in overcrowded steamboats, and unsafe
conveyances and places of all kinds.&nbsp; And I cannot help
thinking that instead of railing, and attributing savage motives
to a people naturally well disposed and humane, it is better to
teach them, and lead them argumentatively and
reasonably&mdash;for they are very reasonable, if you will
discuss a matter with them&mdash;to more considerate and wise
conclusions.</p>
<p>This is a disagreeable intrusion!&nbsp; Here is a man with his
throat cut, dashing towards me as I lie awake!&nbsp; A
recollection of an old story of a kinsman of mine, who, going
home one foggy winter night to Hampstead, when London was much
smaller and the road lonesome, suddenly encountered such a figure
rushing past him, and presently two keepers from a madhouse in
pursuit.&nbsp; A very unpleasant creature indeed, to come into my
mind unbidden, as I lie awake.</p>
<p>&mdash;The balloon ascents of last season.&nbsp; I must return
to the balloons.&nbsp; Why did the bleeding man start out of
them?&nbsp; Never mind; if I inquire, he will be back
again.&nbsp; The balloons.&nbsp; This particular public have
inherently a great pleasure in the contemplation of physical
difficulties overcome; mainly, as I take it, because the lives of
a large majority of them are exceedingly monotonous and real, and
further, are a struggle against continual difficulties, and
further still, because anything in the form of accidental injury,
or any kind of illness or disability is so very serious in their
own sphere.&nbsp; I will explain this seeming paradox of
mine.&nbsp; Take the case of a Christmas Pantomime.&nbsp; Surely
nobody supposes that the young mother in the pit who falls into
fits of laughter when the baby is boiled or sat upon, would be at
all diverted by such an occurrence off the stage.&nbsp; Nor is
the decent workman in the gallery, who is transported beyond the
ignorant present by the delight with which he sees a stout
gentleman pushed out of a two pair of stairs window, to be
slandered by the suspicion that he would be in the least
entertained by such a spectacle in any street in London, Paris,
or New York.&nbsp; It always appears to me that the secret of
this enjoyment lies in the temporary superiority to the common
hazards and mischances of life; in seeing casualties, attended
when they really occur with bodily and mental suffering, tears,
and poverty, happen through a very rough sort of poetry without
the least harm being done to any one&mdash;the pretence of
distress in a pantomime being so broadly humorous as to be no
pretence at all.&nbsp; Much as in the comic fiction I can
understand the mother with a very vulnerable baby at home,
greatly relishing the invulnerable baby on the stage, so in the
Cremorne reality I can understand the mason who is always liable
to fall off a scaffold in his working jacket and to be carried to
the hospital, having an infinite admiration of the radiant
personage in spangles who goes into the clouds upon a bull, or
upside down, and who, he takes it for granted&mdash;not
reflecting upon the thing&mdash;has, by uncommon skill and
dexterity, conquered such mischances as those to which he and his
acquaintance are continually exposed.</p>
<p>I wish the Morgue in Paris would not come here as I lie awake,
with its ghastly beds, and the swollen saturated clothes hanging
up, and the water dripping, dripping all day long, upon that
other swollen saturated something in the corner, like a heap of
crushed over-ripe figs that I have seen in Italy!&nbsp; And this
detestable Morgue comes back again at the head of a procession of
forgotten ghost stories.&nbsp; This will never do.&nbsp; I must
think of something else as I lie awake; or, like that sagacious
animal in the United States who recognised the colonel who was
such a dead shot, I am a gone &rsquo;Coon.&nbsp; What shall I
think of?&nbsp; The late brutal assaults.&nbsp; Very good
subject.&nbsp; The late brutal assaults.</p>
<p>(Though whether, supposing I should see, here before me as I
lie awake, the awful phantom described in one of those ghost
stories, who, with a head-dress of shroud, was always seen
looking in through a certain glass door at a certain dead
hour&mdash;whether, in such a case it would be the least
consolation to me to know on philosophical grounds that it was
merely my imagination, is a question I can&rsquo;t help asking
myself by the way.)</p>
<p>The late brutal assaults.&nbsp; I strongly question the
expediency of advocating the revival of whipping for those
crimes.&nbsp; It is a natural and generous impulse to be
indignant at the perpetration of inconceivable brutality, but I
doubt the whipping panacea gravely.&nbsp; Not in the least regard
or pity for the criminal, whom I hold in far lower estimation
than a mad wolf, but in consideration for the general tone and
feeling, which is very much improved since the whipping
times.&nbsp; It is bad for a people to be familiarised with such
punishments.&nbsp; When the whip went out of Bridewell, and
ceased to be flourished at the carts tail and at the
whipping-post, it began to fade out of madhouses, and workhouses,
and schools and families, and to give place to a better system
everywhere, than cruel driving.&nbsp; It would be hasty, because
a few brutes may be inadequately punished, to revive, in any
aspect, what, in so many aspects, society is hardly yet happily
rid of.&nbsp; The whip is a very contagious kind of thing, and
difficult to confine within one set of bounds.&nbsp; Utterly
abolish punishment by fine&mdash;a barbarous device, quite as
much out of date as wager by battle, but particularly connected
in the vulgar mind with this class of offence&mdash;at least
quadruple the term of imprisonment for aggravated
assaults&mdash;and above all let us, in such cases, have no Pet
Prisoning, vain glorifying, strong soup, and roasted meats, but
hard work, and one unchanging and uncompromising dietary of bread
and water, well or ill; and we shall do much better than by going
down into the dark to grope for the whip among the rusty
fragments of the rack, and the branding iron, and the chains and
gibbet from the public roads, and the weights that pressed men to
death in the cells of Newgate.</p>
<p>I had proceeded thus far, when I found I had been lying awake
so long that the very dead began to wake too, and to crowd into
my thoughts most sorrowfully.&nbsp; Therefore, I resolved to lie
awake no more, but to get up and go out for a night
walk&mdash;which resolution was an acceptable relief to me, as I
dare say it may prove now to a great many more.</p>
<h2><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>THE
GHOST OF ART</h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">AM</span> a bachelor, residing in
rather a dreary set of chambers in the Temple.&nbsp; They are
situated in a square court of high houses, which would be a
complete well, but for the want of water and the absence of a
bucket.&nbsp; I live at the top of the house, among the tiles and
sparrows.&nbsp; Like the little man in the nursery-story, I live
by myself, and all the bread and cheese I get&mdash;which is not
much&mdash;I put upon a shelf.&nbsp; I need scarcely add,
perhaps, that I am in love, and that the father of my charming
Julia objects to our union.</p>
<p>I mention these little particulars as I might deliver a letter
of introduction.&nbsp; The reader is now acquainted with me, and
perhaps will condescend to listen to my narrative.</p>
<p>I am naturally of a dreamy turn of mind; and my abundant
leisure&mdash;for I am called to the Bar&mdash;coupled with much
lonely listening to the twittering of sparrows, and the pattering
of rain, has encouraged that disposition.&nbsp; In my &lsquo;top
set&rsquo; I hear the wind howl on a winter night, when the man
on the ground floor believes it is perfectly still weather.&nbsp;
The dim lamps with which our Honourable Society (supposed to be
as yet unconscious of the new discovery called Gas) make the
horrors of the staircase visible, deepen the gloom which
generally settles on my soul when I go home at night.</p>
<p>I am in the Law, but not of it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t exactly
make out what it means.&nbsp; I sit in Westminster Hall sometimes
(in character) from ten to four; and when I go out of Court, I
don&rsquo;t know whether I am standing on my wig or my boots.</p>
<p>It appears to me (I mention this in confidence) as if there
were too much talk and too much law&mdash;as if some grains of
truth were started overboard into a tempestuous sea of chaff.</p>
<p>All this may make me mystical.&nbsp; Still, I am confident
that what I am going to describe myself as having seen and heard,
I actually did see and hear.</p>
<p>It is necessary that I should observe that I have a great
delight in pictures.&nbsp; I am no painter myself, but I have
studied pictures and written about them.&nbsp; I have seen all
the most famous pictures in the world; my education and reading
have been sufficiently general to possess me beforehand with a
knowledge of most of the subjects to which a Painter is likely to
have recourse; and, although I might be in some doubt as to the
rightful fashion of the scabbard of King Lear&rsquo;s sword, for
instance, I think I should know King Lear tolerably well, if I
happened to meet with him.</p>
<p>I go to all the Modern Exhibitions every season, and of course
I revere the Royal Academy.&nbsp; I stand by its forty Academical
articles almost as firmly as I stand by the thirty-nine Articles
of the Church of England.&nbsp; I am convinced that in neither
case could there be, by any rightful possibility, one article
more or less.</p>
<p>It is now exactly three years&mdash;three years ago, this very
month&mdash;since I went from Westminster to the Temple, one
Thursday afternoon, in a cheap steamboat.&nbsp; The sky was
black, when I imprudently walked on board.&nbsp; It began to
thunder and lighten immediately afterwards, and the rain poured
down in torrents.&nbsp; The deck seeming to smoke with the wet, I
went below; but so many passengers were there, smoking too, that
I came up again, and buttoning my pea-coat, and standing in the
shadow of the paddle-box, stood as upright as I could, and made
the best of it.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that I first beheld the terrible Being,
who is the subject of my present recollections.</p>
<p>Standing against the funnel, apparently with the intention of
drying himself by the heat as fast as he got wet, was a shabby
man in threadbare black, and with his hands in his pockets, who
fascinated me from the memorable instant when I caught his
eye.</p>
<p>Where had I caught that eye before?&nbsp; Who was he?&nbsp;
Why did I connect him, all at once, with the Vicar of Wakefield,
Alfred the Great, Gil Blas, Charles the Second, Joseph and his
Brethren, the Fairy Queen, Tom Jones, the Decameron of Boccaccio,
Tam O&rsquo;Shanter, the Marriage of the Doge of Venice with the
Adriatic, and the Great Plague of London?&nbsp; Why, when he bent
one leg, and placed one hand upon the back of the seat near him,
did my mind associate him wildly with the words, &lsquo;Number
one hundred and forty-two, Portrait of a gentleman&rsquo;?&nbsp;
Could it be that I was going mad?</p>
<p>I looked at him again, and now I could have taken my affidavit
that he belonged to the Vicar of Wakefield&rsquo;s family.&nbsp;
Whether he was the Vicar, or Moses, or Mr. Burchill, or the
Squire, or a conglomeration of all four, I knew not; but I was
impelled to seize him by the throat, and charge him with being,
in some fell way, connected with the Primrose blood.&nbsp; He
looked up at the rain, and then&mdash;oh Heaven!&mdash;he became
Saint John.&nbsp; He folded his arms, resigning himself to the
weather, and I was frantically inclined to address him as the
Spectator, and firmly demand to know what he had done with Sir
Roger de Coverley.</p>
<p>The frightful suspicion that I was becoming deranged, returned
upon me with redoubled force.&nbsp; Meantime, this awful
stranger, inexplicably linked to my distress, stood drying
himself at the funnel; and ever, as the steam rose from his
clothes, diffusing a mist around him, I saw through the ghostly
medium all the people I have mentioned, and a score more, sacred
and profane.</p>
<p>I am conscious of a dreadful inclination that stole upon me,
as it thundered and lightened, to grapple with this man, or
demon, and plunge him over the side.&nbsp; But, I constrained
myself&mdash;I know not how&mdash;to speak to him, and in a pause
of the storm, I crossed the deck, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He replied, hoarsely, &lsquo;A Model.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A what?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Model,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I sets to the
profession for a bob a-hour.&rsquo;&nbsp; (All through this
narrative I give his own words, which are indelibly imprinted on
my memory.)</p>
<p>The relief which this disclosure gave me, the exquisite
delight of the restoration of my confidence in my own sanity, I
cannot describe.&nbsp; I should have fallen on his neck, but for
the consciousness of being observed by the man at the wheel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You then,&rsquo; said I, shaking him so warmly by the
hand, that I wrung the rain out of his coat-cuff, &lsquo;are the
gentleman whom I have so frequently contemplated, in connection
with a high-backed chair with a red cushion, and a table with
twisted legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am that Model,&rsquo; he rejoined moodily, &lsquo;and
I wish I was anything else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say not so,&rsquo; I returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have seen
you in the society of many beautiful young women;&rsquo; as in
truth I had, and always (I now remember) in the act of making the
most of his legs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve
seen me along with warses of flowers, and any number of
table-kivers, and antique cabinets, and warious
gammon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And warious gammon,&rsquo; he repeated, in a louder
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;You might have seen me in armour, too, if you
had looked sharp.&nbsp; Blessed if I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stood in
half the suits of armour as ever came out of Pratt&rsquo;s shop:
and sat, for weeks together, a-eating nothing, out of half the
gold and silver dishes as has ever been lent for the purpose out
of Storrses, and Mortimerses, or Garrardses, and
Davenportseseses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Excited, as it appeared, by a sense of injury, I thought he
would never have found an end for the last word.&nbsp; But, at
length it rolled sullenly away with the thunder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are a
well-favoured, well-made man, and yet&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I
find, on examining my mind, that I associate you with&mdash;that
my recollection indistinctly makes you, in short&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;a kind of powerful monster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a wonder if it didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know what my points are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My throat and my legs,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When I don&rsquo;t set for a head, I mostly sets for a
throat and a pair of legs.&nbsp; Now, granted you was a painter,
and was to work at my throat for a week together, I suppose
you&rsquo;d see a lot of lumps and bumps there, that would never
be there at all, if you looked at me, complete, instead of only
my throat.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Probably,&rsquo; said I, surveying him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it stands to reason,&rsquo; said the Model.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Work another week at my legs, and it&rsquo;ll be the same
thing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em out as knotty and as
knobby, at last, as if they was the trunks of two old
trees.&nbsp; Then, take and stick my legs and throat on to
another man&rsquo;s body, and you&rsquo;ll make a reg&rsquo;lar
monster.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the way the public gets their
reg&rsquo;lar monsters, every first Monday in May, when the Royal
Academy Exhibition opens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a critic,&rsquo; said I, with an air of
deference.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in an uncommon ill humour, if that&rsquo;s
it,&rsquo; rejoined the Model, with great indignation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As if it warn&rsquo;t bad enough for a bob a-hour, for a
man to be mixing himself up with that there jolly old furniter
that one &lsquo;ud think the public know&rsquo;d the wery nails
in by this time&mdash;or to be putting on greasy old &lsquo;ats
and cloaks, and playing tambourines in the Bay o&rsquo; Naples,
with Wesuvius a smokin&rsquo; according to pattern in the
background, and the wines a bearing wonderful in the middle
distance&mdash;or to be unpolitely kicking up his legs among a
lot o&rsquo; gals, with no reason whatever in his mind but to
show &rsquo;em&mdash;as if this warn&rsquo;t bad enough,
I&rsquo;m to go and be thrown out of employment too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely no!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely yes,&rsquo; said the indignant Model.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">But I&rsquo;ll grow
one</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gloomy and threatening manner in which he muttered the
last words, can never be effaced from my remembrance.&nbsp; My
blood ran cold.</p>
<p>I asked of myself, what was it that this desperate Being was
resolved to grow.&nbsp; My breast made no response.</p>
<p>I ventured to implore him to explain his meaning.&nbsp; With a
scornful laugh, he uttered this dark prophecy:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">I&rsquo;ll grow one</span>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">And</span>, <span class="smcap">mark my
words</span>, <span class="smcap">it shall haunt
you</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We parted in the storm, after I had forced half-a-crown on his
acceptance, with a trembling hand.&nbsp; I conclude that
something supernatural happened to the steamboat, as it bore his
reeking figure down the river; but it never got into the
papers.</p>
<p>Two years elapsed, during which I followed my profession
without any vicissitudes; never holding so much as a motion, of
course.&nbsp; At the expiration of that period, I found myself
making my way home to the Temple, one night, in precisely such
another storm of thunder and lightning as that by which I had
been overtaken on board the steamboat&mdash;except that this
storm, bursting over the town at midnight, was rendered much more
awful by the darkness and the hour.</p>
<p>As I turned into my court, I really thought a thunderbolt
would fall, and plough the pavement up.&nbsp; Every brick and
stone in the place seemed to have an echo of its own for the
thunder.&nbsp; The waterspouts were overcharged, and the rain
came tearing down from the house-tops as if they had been
mountain-tops.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parkins, my laundress&mdash;wife of Parkins the porter,
then newly dead of a dropsy&mdash;had particular instructions to
place a bedroom candle and a match under the staircase lamp on my
landing, in order that I might light my candle there, whenever I
came home.&nbsp; Mrs. Parkins invariably disregarding all
instructions, they were never there.&nbsp; Thus it happened that
on this occasion I groped my way into my sitting-room to find the
candle, and came out to light it.</p>
<p>What were my emotions when, underneath the staircase lamp,
shining with wet as if he had never been dry since our last
meeting, stood the mysterious Being whom I had encountered on the
steamboat in a thunderstorm, two years before!&nbsp; His
prediction rushed upon my mind, and I turned faint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said I&rsquo;d do it,&rsquo; he observed, in a hollow
voice, &lsquo;and I have done it.&nbsp; May I come in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Misguided creature, what have you done?&rsquo; I
returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know,&rsquo; was his reply,
&lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll let me in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Could it be murder that he had done?&nbsp; And had he been so
successful that he wanted to do it again, at my expense?</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I come in?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I inclined my head, with as much presence of mind as I could
command, and he followed me into my chambers.&nbsp; There, I saw
that the lower part of his face was tied up, in what is commonly
called a Belcher handkerchief.&nbsp; He slowly removed this
bandage, and exposed to view a long dark beard, curling over his
upper lip, twisting about the corners of his mouth, and hanging
down upon his breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; I exclaimed involuntarily,
&lsquo;and what have you become?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the Ghost of Art!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>The effect of these words, slowly uttered in the thunder-storm
at midnight, was appalling in the last degree.&nbsp; More dead
than alive, I surveyed him in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The German taste came up,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
threw me out of bread.&nbsp; I am ready for the taste
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made his beard a little jagged with his hands, folded his
arms, and said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Severity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I shuddered.&nbsp; It was so severe.</p>
<p>He made his beard flowing on his breast, and, leaning both
hands on the staff of a carpet-broom which Mrs. Parkins had left
among my books, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Benevolence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I stood transfixed.&nbsp; The change of sentiment was entirely
in the beard.&nbsp; The man might have left his face alone, or
had no face.</p>
<p>The beard did everything.</p>
<p>He lay down, on his back, on my table, and with that action of
his head threw up his beard at the chin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s death!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>He got off my table and, looking up at the ceiling, cocked his
beard a little awry; at the same time making it stick out before
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Adoration, or a vow of vengeance,&rsquo; he
observed.</p>
<p>He turned his profile to me, making his upper lip very bulky
with the upper part of his beard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Romantic character,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>He looked sideways out of his beard, as if it were an
ivy-bush.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jealousy,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; He gave it
an ingenious twist in the air, and informed me that he was
carousing.&nbsp; He made it shaggy with his fingers&mdash;and it
was Despair; lank&mdash;and it was avarice: tossed it all kinds
of ways&mdash;and it was rage.&nbsp; The beard did
everything.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the Ghost of Art,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two
bob a-day now, and more when it&rsquo;s longer!&nbsp;
Hair&rsquo;s the true expression.&nbsp; There is no other.&nbsp;
I <span class="smcap">said I&rsquo;d grow it</span>, <span
class="smcap">and I&rsquo;ve grown it</span>, <span
class="smcap">and it shall haunt you</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He may have tumbled down-stairs in the dark, but he never
walked down or ran down.&nbsp; I looked over the banisters, and I
was alone with the thunder.</p>
<p>Need I add more of my terrific fate?&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">It has</span> haunted me ever since.&nbsp; It
glares upon me from the walls of the Royal Academy, (except when
<span class="smcap">Maclise</span> subdues it to his genius,) it
fills my soul with terror at the British Institution, it lures
young artists on to their destruction.&nbsp; Go where I will, the
Ghost of Art, eternally working the passions in hair, and
expressing everything by beard, pursues me.&nbsp; The prediction
is accomplished, and the victim has no rest.</p>
<h2><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>OUT
OF TOWN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sitting</span>, on a bright September
morning, among my books and papers at my open window on the cliff
overhanging the sea-beach, I have the sky and ocean framed before
me like a beautiful picture.&nbsp; A beautiful picture, but with
such movement in it, such changes of light upon the sails of
ships and wake of steamboats, such dazzling gleams of silver far
out at sea, such fresh touches on the crisp wave-tops as they
break and roll towards me&mdash;a picture with such music in the
billowy rush upon the shingle, the blowing of morning wind
through the corn-sheaves where the farmers&rsquo; waggons are
busy, the singing of the larks, and the distant voices of
children at play&mdash;such charms of sight and sound as all the
Galleries on earth can but poorly suggest.</p>
<p>So dreamy is the murmur of the sea below my window, that I may
have been here, for anything I know, one hundred years.&nbsp; Not
that I have grown old, for, daily on the neighbouring downs and
grassy hill-sides, I find that I can still in reason walk any
distance, jump over anything, and climb up anywhere; but, that
the sound of the ocean seems to have become so customary to my
musings, and other realities seem so to have gone aboard ship and
floated away over the horizon, that, for aught I will undertake
to the contrary, I am the enchanted son of the King my father,
shut up in a tower on the sea-shore, for protection against an
old she-goblin who insisted on being my godmother, and who
foresaw at the font&mdash;wonderful creature!&mdash;that I should
get into a scrape before I was twenty-one.&nbsp; I remember to
have been in a City (my Royal parent&rsquo;s dominions, I
suppose), and apparently not long ago either, that was in the
dreariest condition.&nbsp; The principal inhabitants had all been
changed into old newspapers, and in that form were preserving
their window-blinds from dust, and wrapping all their smaller
household gods in curl-papers.&nbsp; I walked through gloomy
streets where every house was shut up and newspapered, and where
my solitary footsteps echoed on the deserted pavements.&nbsp; In
the public rides there were no carriages, no horses, no animated
existence, but a few sleepy policemen, and a few adventurous boys
taking advantage of the devastation to swarm up the
lamp-posts.&nbsp; In the Westward streets there was no traffic;
in the Westward shops, no business.&nbsp; The water-patterns
which the &rsquo;Prentices had trickled out on the pavements
early in the morning, remained uneffaced by human feet.&nbsp; At
the corners of mews, Cochin-China fowls stalked gaunt and savage;
nobody being left in the deserted city (as it appeared to me), to
feed them.&nbsp; Public Houses, where splendid footmen swinging
their legs over gorgeous hammer-cloths beside wigged coachmen
were wont to regale, were silent, and the unused pewter pots
shone, too bright for business, on the shelves.&nbsp; I beheld a
Punch&rsquo;s Show leaning against a wall near Park Lane, as if
it had fainted.&nbsp; It was deserted, and there were none to
heed its desolation.&nbsp; In Belgrave Square I met the last
man&mdash;an ostler&mdash;sitting on a post in a ragged red
waistcoat, eating straw, and mildewing away.</p>
<p>If I recollect the name of the little town, on whose shore
this sea is murmuring&mdash;but I am not just now, as I have
premised, to be relied upon for anything&mdash;it is
Pavilionstone.&nbsp; Within a quarter of a century, it was a
little fishing town, and they do say, that the time was, when it
was a little smuggling town.&nbsp; I have heard that it was
rather famous in the hollands and brandy way, and that coevally
with that reputation the lamplighter&rsquo;s was considered a bad
life at the Assurance Offices.&nbsp; It was observed that if he
were not particular about lighting up, he lived in peace; but
that, if he made the best of the oil-lamps in the steep and
narrow streets, he usually fell over the cliff at an early
age.&nbsp; Now, gas and electricity run to the very water&rsquo;s
edge, and the South-Eastern Railway Company screech at us in the
dead of night.</p>
<p>But, the old little fishing and smuggling town remains, and is
so tempting a place for the latter purpose, that I think of going
out some night next week, in a fur cap and a pair of petticoat
trousers, and running an empty tub, as a kind of
arch&aelig;ological pursuit.&nbsp; Let nobody with corns come to
Pavilionstone, for there are breakneck flights of ragged steps,
connecting the principal streets by back-ways, which will cripple
that visitor in half an hour.&nbsp; These are the ways by which,
when I run that tub, I shall escape.&nbsp; I shall make a
Thermopyl&aelig; of the corner of one of them, defend it with my
cutlass against the coast-guard until my brave companions have
sheered off, then dive into the darkness, and regain my
Susan&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; In connection with these breakneck
steps I observe some wooden cottages, with tumble-down
out-houses, and back-yards three feet square, adorned with
garlands of dried fish, in one of which (though the General Board
of Health might object) my Susan dwells.</p>
<p>The South-Eastern Company have brought Pavilionstone into such
vogue, with their tidal trains and splendid steam-packets, that a
new Pavilionstone is rising up.&nbsp; I am, myself, of New
Pavilionstone.&nbsp; We are a little mortary and limey at
present, but we are getting on capitally.&nbsp; Indeed, we were
getting on so fast, at one time, that we rather overdid it, and
built a street of shops, the business of which may be expected to
arrive in about ten years.&nbsp; We are sensibly laid out in
general; and with a little care and pains (by no means wanting,
so far), shall become a very pretty place.&nbsp; We ought to be,
for our situation is delightful, our air is delicious, and our
breezy hills and downs, carpeted with wild thyme, and decorated
with millions of wild flowers, are, on the faith of a pedestrian,
perfect.&nbsp; In New Pavilionstone we are a little too much
addicted to small windows with more bricks in them than glass,
and we are not over-fanciful in the way of decorative
architecture, and we get unexpected sea-views through cracks in
the street doors; on the whole, however, we are very snug and
comfortable, and well accommodated.&nbsp; But the Home Secretary
(if there be such an officer) cannot too soon shut up the
burial-ground of the old parish church.&nbsp; It is in the midst
of us, and Pavilionstone will get no good of it, if it be too
long left alone.</p>
<p>The lion of Pavilionstone is its Great Hotel.&nbsp; A dozen
years ago, going over to Paris by South-Eastern Tidal Steamer,
you used to be dropped upon the platform of the main line
Pavilionstone Station (not a junction then), at eleven
o&rsquo;clock on a dark winter&rsquo;s night, in a roaring wind;
and in the howling wilderness outside the station, was a short
omnibus which brought you up by the forehead the instant you got
in at the door; and nobody cared about you, and you were alone in
the world.&nbsp; You bumped over infinite chalk, until you were
turned out at a strange building which had just left off being a
barn without having quite begun to be a house, where nobody
expected your coming, or knew what to do with you when you were
come, and where you were usually blown about, until you happened
to be blown against the cold beef, and finally into bed.&nbsp; At
five in the morning you were blown out of bed, and after a dreary
breakfast, with crumpled company, in the midst of confusion, were
hustled on board a steamboat and lay wretched on deck until you
saw France lunging and surging at you with great vehemence over
the bowsprit.</p>
<p>Now, you come down to Pavilionstone in a free and easy manner,
an irresponsible agent, made over in trust to the South-Eastern
Company, until you get out of the railway-carriage at high-water
mark.&nbsp; If you are crossing by the boat at once, you have
nothing to do but walk on board and be happy there if you
can&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If you are going to our Great
Pavilionstone Hotel, the sprightliest porters under the sun,
whose cheerful looks are a pleasant welcome, shoulder your
luggage, drive it off in vans, bowl it away in trucks, and enjoy
themselves in playing athletic games with it.&nbsp; If you are
for public life at our great Pavilionstone Hotel, you walk into
that establishment as if it were your club; and find ready for
you, your news-room, dining-room, smoking-room, billiard-room,
music-room, public breakfast, public dinner twice a-day (one
plain, one gorgeous), hot baths and cold baths.&nbsp; If you want
to be bored, there are plenty of bores always ready for you, and
from Saturday to Monday in particular, you can be bored (if you
like it) through and through.&nbsp; Should you want to be private
at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel, say but the word, look at the
list of charges, choose your floor, name your figure&mdash;there
you are, established in your castle, by the day, week, month, or
year, innocent of all comers or goers, unless you have my fancy
for walking early in the morning down the groves of boots and
shoes, which so regularly flourish at all the chamber-doors
before breakfast, that it seems to me as if nobody ever got up or
took them in.&nbsp; Are you going across the Alps, and would you
like to air your Italian at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel?&nbsp;
Talk to the Manager&mdash;always conversational, accomplished,
and polite.&nbsp; Do you want to be aided, abetted, comforted, or
advised, at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel?&nbsp; Send for the
good landlord, and he is your friend.&nbsp; Should you, or any
one belonging to you, ever be taken ill at our Great
Pavilionstone Hotel, you will not soon forget him or his kind
wife.&nbsp; And when you pay your bill at our Great Pavilionstone
Hotel, you will not be put out of humour by anything you find in
it.</p>
<p>A thoroughly good inn, in the days of coaching and posting,
was a noble place.&nbsp; But no such inn would have been equal to
the reception of four or five hundred people, all of them wet
through, and half of them dead sick, every day in the year.&nbsp;
This is where we shine, in our Pavilionstone Hotel.&nbsp;
Again&mdash;who, coming and going, pitching and tossing, boating
and training, hurrying in, and flying out, could ever have
calculated the fees to be paid at an old-fashioned house?&nbsp;
In our Pavilionstone Hotel vocabulary, there is no such word as
fee.&nbsp; Everything is done for you; every service is provided
at a fixed and reasonable charge; all the prices are hung up in
all the rooms; and you can make out your own bill beforehand, as
well as the book-keeper.</p>
<p>In the case of your being a pictorial artist, desirous of
studying at small expense the physiognomies and beards of
different nations, come, on receipt of this, to
Pavilionstone.&nbsp; You shall find all the nations of the earth,
and all the styles of shaving and not shaving, hair cutting and
hair letting alone, for ever flowing through our hotel.&nbsp;
Couriers you shall see by hundreds; fat leathern bags for
five-franc pieces, closing with violent snaps, like discharges of
fire-arms, by thousands; more luggage in a morning than, fifty
years ago, all Europe saw in a week.&nbsp; Looking at trains,
steamboats, sick travellers, and luggage, is our great
Pavilionstone recreation.&nbsp; We are not strong in other public
amusements.&nbsp; We have a Literary and Scientific Institution,
and we have a Working Men&rsquo;s Institution&mdash;may it hold
many gipsy holidays in summer fields, with the kettle boiling,
the band of music playing, and the people dancing; and may I be
on the hill-side, looking on with pleasure at a wholesome sight
too rare in England!&mdash;and we have two or three churches, and
more chapels than I have yet added up.&nbsp; But public
amusements are scarce with us.&nbsp; If a poor theatrical manager
comes with his company to give us, in a loft, Mary Bax, or the
Murder on the Sand Hills, we don&rsquo;t care much for
him&mdash;starve him out, in fact.&nbsp; We take more kindly to
wax-work, especially if it moves; in which case it keeps much
clearer of the second commandment than when it is still.&nbsp;
Cooke&rsquo;s Circus (Mr. Cooke is my friend, and always leaves a
good name behind him) gives us only a night in passing
through.&nbsp; Nor does the travelling menagerie think us worth a
longer visit.&nbsp; It gave us a look-in the other day, bringing
with it the residentiary van with the stained glass windows,
which Her Majesty kept ready-made at Windsor Castle, until she
found a suitable opportunity of submitting it for the
proprietor&rsquo;s acceptance.&nbsp; I brought away five
wonderments from this exhibition.&nbsp; I have wondered ever
since, Whether the beasts ever do get used to those small places
of confinement; Whether the monkeys have that very horrible
flavour in their free state; Whether wild animals have a natural
ear for time and tune, and therefore every four-footed creature
began to howl in despair when the band began to play; What the
giraffe does with his neck when his cart is shut up; and, Whether
the elephant feels ashamed of himself when he is brought out of
his den to stand on his head in the presence of the whole
Collection.</p>
<p>We are a tidal harbour at Pavilionstone, as indeed I have
implied already in my mention of tidal trains.&nbsp; At low
water, we are a heap of mud, with an empty channel in it where a
couple of men in big boots always shovel and scoop: with what
exact object, I am unable to say.&nbsp; At that time, all the
stranded fishing-boats turn over on their sides, as if they were
dead marine monsters; the colliers and other shipping stick
disconsolate in the mud; the steamers look as if their white
chimneys would never smoke more, and their red paddles never turn
again; the green sea-slime and weed upon the rough stones at the
entrance, seem records of obsolete high tides never more to flow;
the flagstaff-halyards droop; the very little wooden lighthouse
shrinks in the idle glare of the sun.&nbsp; And here I may
observe of the very little wooden lighthouse, that when it is
lighted at night,&mdash;red and green,&mdash;it looks so like a
medical man&rsquo;s, that several distracted husbands have at
various times been found, on occasions of premature domestic
anxiety, going round and round it, trying to find the
Nightbell.</p>
<p>But, the moment the tide begins to make, the Pavilionstone
Harbour begins to revive.&nbsp; It feels the breeze of the rising
water before the water comes, and begins to flutter and
stir.&nbsp; When the little shallow waves creep in, barely
overlapping one another, the vanes at the mastheads wake, and
become agitated.&nbsp; As the tide rises, the fishing-boats get
into good spirits and dance, the flagstaff hoists a bright red
flag, the steamboat smokes, cranes creak, horses and carriages
dangle in the air, stray passengers and luggage appear.&nbsp;
Now, the shipping is afloat, and comes up buoyantly, to look at
the wharf.&nbsp; Now, the carts that have come down for coals,
load away as hard as they can load.&nbsp; Now, the steamer smokes
immensely, and occasionally blows at the paddle-boxes like a
vaporous whale-greatly disturbing nervous loungers.&nbsp; Now,
both the tide and the breeze have risen, and you are holding your
hat on (if you want to see how the ladies hold their hats on,
with a stay, passing over the broad brim and down the nose, come
to Pavilionstone).&nbsp; Now, everything in the harbour splashes,
dashes, and bobs.&nbsp; Now, the Down Tidal Train is telegraphed,
and you know (without knowing how you know), that two hundred and
eighty-seven people are coming.&nbsp; Now, the fishing-boats that
have been out, sail in at the top of the tide.&nbsp; Now, the
bell goes, and the locomotive hisses and shrieks, and the train
comes gliding in, and the two hundred and eighty-seven come
scuffling out.&nbsp; Now, there is not only a tide of water, but
a tide of people, and a tide of luggage&mdash;all tumbling and
flowing and bouncing about together.&nbsp; Now, after infinite
bustle, the steamer steams out, and we (on the Pier) are all
delighted when she rolls as if she would roll her funnel out, and
all are disappointed when she don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now, the other
steamer is coming in, and the Custom House prepares, and the
wharf-labourers assemble, and the hawsers are made ready, and the
Hotel Porters come rattling down with van and truck, eager to
begin more Olympic games with more luggage.&nbsp; And this is the
way in which we go on, down at Pavilionstone, every tide.&nbsp;
And, if you want to live a life of luggage, or to see it lived,
or to breathe sweet air which will send you to sleep at a
moment&rsquo;s notice at any period of the day or night, or to
disport yourself upon or in the sea, or to scamper about Kent, or
to come out of town for the enjoyment of all or any of these
pleasures, come to Pavilionstone.</p>
<h2><a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>OUT
OF THE SEASON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> fell to my lot, this last bleak
Spring, to find myself in a watering-place out of the
Season.&nbsp; A vicious north-east squall blew me into it from
foreign parts, and I tarried in it alone for three days, resolved
to be exceedingly busy.</p>
<p>On the first day, I began business by looking for two hours at
the sea, and staring the Foreign Militia out of
countenance.&nbsp; Having disposed of these important
engagements, I sat down at one of the two windows of my room,
intent on doing something desperate in the way of literary
composition, and writing a chapter of unheard-of
excellence&mdash;with which the present essay has no
connexion.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable quality in a watering-place out of the
season, that everything in it, will and must be looked at.&nbsp;
I had no previous suspicion of this fatal truth but, the moment I
sat down to write, I began to perceive it.&nbsp; I had scarcely
fallen into my most promising attitude, and dipped my pen in the
ink, when I found the clock upon the pier&mdash;a red-faced clock
with a white rim&mdash;importuning me in a highly vexatious
manner to consult my watch, and see how I was off for Greenwich
time.&nbsp; Having no intention of making a voyage or taking an
observation, I had not the least need of Greenwich time, and
could have put up with watering-place time as a sufficiently
accurate article.&nbsp; The pier-clock, however, persisting, I
felt it necessary to lay down my pen, compare my watch with him,
and fall into a grave solicitude about half-seconds.&nbsp; I had
taken up my pen again, and was about to commence that valuable
chapter, when a Custom-house cutter under the window requested
that I would hold a naval review of her, immediately.</p>
<p>It was impossible, under the circumstances, for any mental
resolution, merely human, to dismiss the Custom-house cutter,
because the shadow of her topmast fell upon my paper, and the
vane played on the masterly blank chapter.&nbsp; I was therefore
under the necessity of going to the other window; sitting astride
of the chair there, like Napoleon bivouacking in the print; and
inspecting the cutter as she lay, all that day, in the way of my
chapter, O!&nbsp; She was rigged to carry a quantity of canvas,
but her hull was so very small that four giants aboard of her
(three men and a boy) who were vigilantly scraping at her, all
together, inspired me with a terror lest they should scrape her
away.&nbsp; A fifth giant, who appeared to consider himself
&lsquo;below&rsquo;&mdash;as indeed he was, from the waist
downwards&mdash;meditated, in such close proximity with the
little gusty chimney-pipe, that he seemed to be smoking it.&nbsp;
Several boys looked on from the wharf, and, when the gigantic
attention appeared to be fully occupied, one or other of these
would furtively swing himself in mid-air over the Custom-house
cutter, by means of a line pendant from her rigging, like a young
spirit of the storm.&nbsp; Presently, a sixth hand brought down
two little water-casks; presently afterwards, a truck came, and
delivered a hamper.&nbsp; I was now under an obligation to
consider that the cutter was going on a cruise, and to wonder
where she was going, and when she was going, and why she was
going, and at what date she might be expected back, and who
commanded her?&nbsp; With these pressing questions I was fully
occupied when the Packet, making ready to go across, and blowing
off her spare steam, roared, &lsquo;Look at me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It became a positive duty to look at the Packet preparing to
go across; aboard of which, the people newly come down by the
rail-road were hurrying in a great fluster.&nbsp; The crew had
got their tarry overalls on&mdash;and one knew what that
meant&mdash;not to mention the white basins, ranged in neat
little piles of a dozen each, behind the door of the
after-cabin.&nbsp; One lady as I looked, one resigning and
far-seeing woman, took her basin from the store of crockery, as
she might have taken a refreshment-ticket, laid herself down on
deck with that utensil at her ear, muffled her feet in one shawl,
solemnly covered her countenance after the antique manner with
another, and on the completion of these preparations appeared by
the strength of her volition to become insensible.&nbsp; The
mail-bags (O that I myself had the sea-legs of a mail-bag!) were
tumbled aboard; the Packet left off roaring, warped out, and made
at the white line upon the bar.&nbsp; One dip, one roll, one
break of the sea over her bows, and Moore&rsquo;s Almanack or the
sage Raphael could not have told me more of the state of things
aboard, than I knew.</p>
<p>The famous chapter was all but begun now, and would have been
quite begun, but for the wind.&nbsp; It was blowing stiffly from
the east, and it rumbled in the chimney and shook the
house.&nbsp; That was not much; but, looking out into the
wind&rsquo;s grey eye for inspiration, I laid down my pen again
to make the remark to myself, how emphatically everything by the
sea declares that it has a great concern in the state of the
wind.&nbsp; The trees blown all one way; the defences of the
harbour reared highest and strongest against the raging point;
the shingle flung up on the beach from the same direction; the
number of arrows pointed at the common enemy; the sea tumbling in
and rushing towards them as if it were inflamed by the
sight.&nbsp; This put it in my head that I really ought to go out
and take a walk in the wind; so, I gave up the magnificent
chapter for that day, entirely persuading myself that I was under
a moral obligation to have a blow.</p>
<p>I had a good one, and that on the high road&mdash;the very
high road&mdash;on the top of the cliffs, where I met the
stage-coach with all the outsides holding their hats on and
themselves too, and overtook a flock of sheep with the wool about
their necks blown into such great ruffs that they looked like
fleecy owls.&nbsp; The wind played upon the lighthouse as if it
were a great whistle, the spray was driven over the sea in a
cloud of haze, the ships rolled and pitched heavily, and at
intervals long slants and flaws of light made mountain-steeps of
communication between the ocean and the sky.&nbsp; A walk of ten
miles brought me to a seaside town without a cliff, which, like
the town I had come from, was out of the season too.&nbsp; Half
of the houses were shut up; half of the other half were to let;
the town might have done as much business as it was doing then,
if it had been at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; Nobody seemed to
flourish save the attorney; his clerk&rsquo;s pen was going in
the bow-window of his wooden house; his brass door-plate alone
was free from salt, and had been polished up that morning.&nbsp;
On the beach, among the rough buggers and capstans, groups of
storm-beaten boatmen, like a sort of marine monsters, watched
under the lee of those objects, or stood leaning forward against
the wind, looking out through battered spy-glasses.&nbsp; The
parlour bell in the Admiral Benbow had grown so flat with being
out of the season, that neither could I hear it ring when I
pulled the handle for lunch, nor could the young woman in black
stockings and strong shoes, who acted as waiter out of the
season, until it had been tinkled three times.</p>
<p>Admiral Benbow&rsquo;s cheese was out of the season, but his
home-made bread was good, and his beer was perfect.&nbsp; Deluded
by some earlier spring day which had been warm and sunny, the
Admiral had cleared the firing out of his parlour stove, and had
put some flower-pots in&mdash;which was amiable and hopeful in
the Admiral, but not judicious: the room being, at that present
visiting, transcendantly cold.&nbsp; I therefore took the liberty
of peeping out across a little stone passage into the
Admiral&rsquo;s kitchen, and, seeing a high settle with its back
towards me drawn out in front of the Admiral&rsquo;s kitchen
fire, I strolled in, bread and cheese in hand, munching and
looking about.&nbsp; One landsman and two boatmen were seated on
the settle, smoking pipes and drinking beer out of thick pint
crockery mugs&mdash;mugs peculiar to such places, with
parti-coloured rings round them, and ornaments between the rings
like frayed-out roots.&nbsp; The landsman was relating his
experience, as yet only three nights old, of a fearful
running-down case in the Channel, and therein presented to my
imagination a sound of music that it will not soon forget.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At that identical moment of time,&rsquo; said he (he
was a prosy man by nature, who rose with his subject), &lsquo;the
night being light and calm, but with a grey mist upon the water
that didn&rsquo;t seem to spread for more than two or three mile,
I was walking up and down the wooden causeway next the pier, off
where it happened, along with a friend of mine, which his name is
Mr. Clocker.&nbsp; Mr. Clocker is a grocer over
yonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; (From the direction in which he pointed the
bowl of his pipe, I might have judged Mr. Clocker to be a merman,
established in the grocery trade in five-and-twenty fathoms of
water.)&nbsp; &lsquo;We were smoking our pipes, and walking up
and down the causeway, talking of one thing and talking of
another.&nbsp; We were quite alone there, except that a few
hovellers&rsquo; (the Kentish name for &lsquo;long-shore boatmen
like his companions) &lsquo;were hanging about their lugs,
waiting while the tide made, as hovellers will.&rsquo;&nbsp; (One
of the two boatmen, thoughtfully regarding me, shut up one eye;
this I understood to mean: first, that he took me into the
conversation: secondly, that he confirmed the proposition:
thirdly, that he announced himself as a hoveller.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;All of a sudden Mr. Clocker and me stood rooted to the
spot, by hearing a sound come through the stillness, right over
the sea, <i>like a great sorrowful flute or &AElig;olian
harp</i>.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t in the least know what it was,
and judge of our surprise when we saw the hovellers, to a man,
leap into the boats and tear about to hoist sail and get off, as
if they had every one of &rsquo;em gone, in a moment, raving
mad!&nbsp; But <i>they</i> knew it was the cry of distress from
the sinking emigrant ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I got back to my watering-place out of the season, and
had done my twenty miles in good style, I found that the
celebrated Black Mesmerist intended favouring the public that
evening in the Hall of the Muses, which he had engaged for the
purpose.&nbsp; After a good dinner, seated by the fire in an easy
chair, I began to waver in a design I had formed of waiting on
the Black Mesmerist, and to incline towards the expediency of
remaining where I was.&nbsp; Indeed a point of gallantry was
involved in my doing so, inasmuch as I had not left France alone,
but had come from the prisons of St. P&eacute;lagie with my
distinguished and unfortunate friend Madame Roland (in two
volumes which I bought for two francs each, at the book-stall in
the Place de la Concorde, Paris, at the corner of the Rue
Royale).&nbsp; Deciding to pass the evening
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Madame Roland, I derived, as
I always do, great pleasure from that spiritual woman&rsquo;s
society, and the charms of her brave soul and engaging
conversation.&nbsp; I must confess that if she had only some more
faults, only a few more passionate failings of any kind, I might
love her better; but I am content to believe that the deficiency
is in me, and not in her.&nbsp; We spent some sadly interesting
hours together on this occasion, and she told me again of her
cruel discharge from the Abbaye, and of her being re-arrested
before her free feet had sprung lightly up half-a-dozen steps of
her own staircase, and carried off to the prison which she only
left for the guillotine.</p>
<p>Madame Roland and I took leave of one another before
mid-night, and I went to bed full of vast intentions for next
day, in connexion with the unparalleled chapter.&nbsp; To hear
the foreign mail-steamers coming in at dawn of day, and to know
that I was not aboard or obliged to get up, was very comfortable;
so, I rose for the chapter in great force.</p>
<p>I had advanced so far as to sit down at my window again on my
second morning, and to write the first half-line of the chapter
and strike it out, not liking it, when my conscience reproached
me with not having surveyed the watering-place out of the season,
after all, yesterday, but with having gone straight out of it at
the rate of four miles and a half an hour.&nbsp; Obviously the
best amends that I could make for this remissness was to go and
look at it without another moment&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp;
So&mdash;altogether as a matter of duty&mdash;I gave up the
magnificent chapter for another day, and sauntered out with my
hands in my pockets.</p>
<p>All the houses and lodgings ever let to visitors, were to let
that morning.&nbsp; It seemed to have snowed bills with To Let
upon them.&nbsp; This put me upon thinking what the owners of all
those apartments did, out of the season; how they employed their
time, and occupied their minds.&nbsp; They could not be always
going to the Methodist chapels, of which I passed one every other
minute.&nbsp; They must have some other recreation.&nbsp; Whether
they pretended to take one another&rsquo;s lodgings, and opened
one another&rsquo;s tea-caddies in fun?&nbsp; Whether they cut
slices off their own beef and mutton, and made believe that it
belonged to somebody else?&nbsp; Whether they played little
dramas of life, as children do, and said, &lsquo;I ought to come
and look at your apartments, and you ought to ask two guineas
a-week too much, and then I ought to say I must have the rest of
the day to think of it, and then you ought to say that another
lady and gentleman with no children in family had made an offer
very close to your own terms, and you had passed your word to
give them a positive answer in half an hour, and indeed were just
going to take the bill down when you heard the knock, and then I
ought to take them, you know?&rsquo;&nbsp; Twenty such
speculations engaged my thoughts.&nbsp; Then, after passing,
still clinging to the walls, defaced rags of the bills of last
year&rsquo;s Circus, I came to a back field near a timber-yard
where the Circus itself had been, and where there was yet a sort
of monkish tonsure on the grass, indicating the spot where the
young lady had gone round upon her pet steed Firefly in her
daring flight.&nbsp; Turning into the town again, I came among
the shops, and they were emphatically out of the season.&nbsp;
The chemist had no boxes of ginger-beer powders, no beautifying
sea-side soaps and washes, no attractive scents; nothing but his
great goggle-eyed red bottles, looking as if the winds of winter
and the drift of the salt-sea had inflamed them.&nbsp; The
grocers&rsquo; hot pickles, Harvey&rsquo;s Sauce, Doctor
Kitchener&rsquo;s Zest, Anchovy Paste, Dundee Marmalade, and the
whole stock of luxurious helps to appetite, were hybernating
somewhere underground.&nbsp; The china-shop had no trifles from
anywhere.&nbsp; The Bazaar had given in altogether, and presented
a notice on the shutters that this establishment would re-open at
Whitsuntide, and that the proprietor in the meantime might be
heard of at Wild Lodge, East Cliff.&nbsp; At the Sea-bathing
Establishment, a row of neat little wooden houses seven or eight
feet high, I saw the proprietor in bed in the shower-bath.&nbsp;
As to the bathing-machines, they were (how they got there, is not
for me to say) at the top of a hill at least a mile and a half
off.&nbsp; The library, which I had never seen otherwise than
wide open, was tight shut; and two peevish bald old gentlemen
seemed to be hermetically sealed up inside, eternally reading the
paper.&nbsp; That wonderful mystery, the music-shop, carried it
off as usual (except that it had more cabinet pianos in stock),
as if season or no season were all one to it.&nbsp; It made the
same prodigious display of bright brazen wind-instruments,
horribly twisted, worth, as I should conceive, some thousands of
pounds, and which it is utterly impossible that anybody in any
season can ever play or want to play.&nbsp; It had five triangles
in the window, six pairs of castanets, and three harps; likewise
every polka with a coloured frontispiece that ever was published;
from the original one where a smooth male and female Pole of high
rank are coming at the observer with their arms a-kimbo, to the
Ratcatcher&rsquo;s Daughter.&nbsp; Astonishing establishment,
amazing enigma!&nbsp; Three other shops were pretty much out of
the season, what they were used to be in it.&nbsp; First, the
shop where they sell the sailors&rsquo; watches, which had still
the old collection of enormous timekeepers, apparently designed
to break a fall from the masthead: with places to wind them up,
like fire-plugs.&nbsp; Secondly, the shop where they sell the
sailors&rsquo; clothing, which displayed the old
sou&rsquo;-westers, and the old oily suits, and the old
pea-jackets, and the old one sea-chest, with its handles like a
pair of rope ear-rings.&nbsp; Thirdly, the unchangeable shop for
the sale of literature that has been left behind.&nbsp; Here, Dr.
Faustus was still going down to very red and yellow perdition,
under the superintendence of three green personages of a scaly
humour, with excrescential serpents growing out of their
blade-bones.&nbsp; Here, the Golden Dreamer, and the Norwood
Fortune Teller, were still on sale at sixpence each, with
instructions for making the dumb cake, and reading destinies in
tea-cups, and with a picture of a young woman with a high waist
lying on a sofa in an attitude so uncomfortable as almost to
account for her dreaming at one and the same time of a
conflagration, a shipwreck, an earthquake, a skeleton, a
church-porch, lightning, funerals performed, and a young man in a
bright blue coat and canary pantaloons.&nbsp; Here, were Little
Warblers and Fairburn&rsquo;s Comic Songsters.&nbsp; Here, too,
were ballads on the old ballad paper and in the old confusion of
types; with an old man in a cocked hat, and an arm-chair, for the
illustration to Will Watch the bold Smuggler; and the Friar of
Orders Grey, represented by a little girl in a hoop, with a ship
in the distance.&nbsp; All these as of yore, when they were
infinite delights to me!</p>
<p>It took me so long fully to relish these many enjoyments, that
I had not more than an hour before bedtime to devote to Madame
Roland.&nbsp; We got on admirably together on the subject of her
convent education, and I rose next morning with the full
conviction that the day for the great chapter was at last
arrived.</p>
<p>It had fallen calm, however, in the night, and as I sat at
breakfast I blushed to remember that I had not yet been on the
Downs.&nbsp; I a walker, and not yet on the Downs!&nbsp; Really,
on so quiet and bright a morning this must be set right.&nbsp; As
an essential part of the Whole Duty of Man, therefore, I left the
chapter to itself&mdash;for the present&mdash;and went on the
Downs.&nbsp; They were wonderfully green and beautiful, and gave
me a good deal to do.&nbsp; When I had done with the free air and
the view, I had to go down into the valley and look after the
hops (which I know nothing about), and to be equally solicitous
as to the cherry orchards.&nbsp; Then I took it on myself to
cross-examine a tramping family in black (mother alleged, I have
no doubt by herself in person, to have died last week), and to
accompany eighteenpence which produced a great effect, with moral
admonitions which produced none at all.&nbsp; Finally, it was
late in the afternoon before I got back to the unprecedented
chapter, and then I determined that it was out of the season, as
the place was, and put it away.</p>
<p>I went at night to the benefit of Mrs. B. Wedgington at the
Theatre, who had placarded the town with the admonition,
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Don&rsquo;t forget
it</span>!&rsquo;&nbsp; I made the house, according to my
calculation, four and ninepence to begin with, and it may have
warmed up, in the course of the evening, to half a
sovereign.&nbsp; There was nothing to offend any one,&mdash;the
good Mr. Baines of Leeds excepted.&nbsp; Mrs. B. Wedgington sang
to a grand piano.&nbsp; Mr. B. Wedgington did the like, and also
took off his coat, tucked up his trousers, and danced in
clogs.&nbsp; Master B. Wedgington, aged ten months, was nursed by
a shivering young person in the boxes, and the eye of Mrs. B.
Wedgington wandered that way more than once.&nbsp; Peace be with
all the Wedgingtons from A. to Z.&nbsp; May they find themselves
in the Season somewhere!</p>
<h2><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>A
POOR MAN&rsquo;S TALE OF A PATENT</h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">AM</span> not used to writing for
print.&nbsp; What working-man, that never labours less (some
Mondays, and Christmas Time and Easter Time excepted) than twelve
or fourteen hours a day, is?&nbsp; But I have been asked to put
down, plain, what I have got to say; and so I take pen-and-ink,
and do it to the best of my power, hoping defects will find
excuse.</p>
<p>I was born nigh London, but have worked in a shop at
Birmingham (what you would call Manufactories, we call Shops),
almost ever since I was out of my time.&nbsp; I served my
apprenticeship at Deptford, nigh where I was born, and I am a
smith by trade.&nbsp; My name is John.&nbsp; I have been called
&lsquo;Old John&rsquo; ever since I was nineteen year of age, on
account of not having much hair.&nbsp; I am fifty-six year of age
at the present time, and I don&rsquo;t find myself with more
hair, nor yet with less, to signify, than at nineteen year of age
aforesaid.</p>
<p>I have been married five and thirty year, come next
April.&nbsp; I was married on All Fools&rsquo; Day.&nbsp; Let
them laugh that will.&nbsp; I won a good wife that day, and it
was as sensible a day to me as ever I had.</p>
<p>We have had a matter of ten children, six whereof are
living.&nbsp; My eldest son is engineer in the Italian
steam-packet &lsquo;Mezzo Giorno, plying between Marseilles and
Naples, and calling at Genoa, Leghorn, and Civita
Vecchia.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a good workman.&nbsp; He invented a
many useful little things that brought him
in&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; I have two sons doing well at Sydney, New
South Wales&mdash;single, when last heard from.&nbsp; One of my
sons (James) went wild and for a soldier, where he was shot in
India, living six weeks in hospital with a musket-ball lodged in
his shoulder-blade, which he wrote with his own hand.&nbsp; He
was the best looking.&nbsp; One of my two daughters (Mary) is
comfortable in her circumstances, but water on the chest.&nbsp;
The other (Charlotte), her husband run away from her in the
basest manner, and she and her three children live with us.&nbsp;
The youngest, six year old, has a turn for mechanics.</p>
<p>I am not a Chartist, and I never was.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean
to say but what I see a good many public points to complain of,
still I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way to set them
right.&nbsp; If I did think so, I should be a Chartist.&nbsp; But
I don&rsquo;t think so, and I am not a Chartist.&nbsp; I read the
paper, and hear discussion, at what we call &lsquo;a
parlour,&rsquo; in Birmingham, and I know many good men and
workmen who are Chartists.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; Not Physical
force.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be took as boastful in me, if I make the remark
(for I can&rsquo;t put down what I have got to say, without
putting that down before going any further), that I have always
been of an ingenious turn.&nbsp; I once got twenty pound by a
screw, and it&rsquo;s in use now.&nbsp; I have been twenty year,
off and on, completing an Invention and perfecting it.&nbsp; I
perfected of it, last Christmas Eve at ten o&rsquo;clock at
night.&nbsp; Me and my wife stood and let some tears fall over
the Model, when it was done and I brought her in to take a look
at it.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, by the name of William Butcher, is a
Chartist.&nbsp; Moderate.&nbsp; He is a good speaker.&nbsp; He is
very animated.&nbsp; I have often heard him deliver that what is,
at every turn, in the way of us working-men, is, that too many
places have been made, in the course of time, to provide for
people that never ought to have been provided for; and that we
have to obey forms and to pay fees to support those places when
we shouldn&rsquo;t ought.&nbsp; &lsquo;True,&rsquo; (delivers
William Butcher), &lsquo;all the public has to do this, but it
falls heaviest on the working-man, because he has least to spare;
and likewise because impediments shouldn&rsquo;t be put in his
way, when he wants redress of wrong or furtherance of
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; I have wrote down those words
from William Butcher&rsquo;s own mouth.&nbsp; W. B. delivering
them fresh for the aforesaid purpose.</p>
<p>Now, to my Model again.&nbsp; There it was, perfected of, on
Christmas Eve, gone nigh a year, at ten o&rsquo;clock at
night.&nbsp; All the money I could spare I had laid out upon the
Model; and when times was bad, or my daughter Charlotte&rsquo;s
children sickly, or both, it had stood still, months at a
spell.&nbsp; I had pulled it to pieces, and made it over again
with improvements, I don&rsquo;t know how often.&nbsp; There it
stood, at last, a perfected Model as aforesaid.</p>
<p>William Butcher and me had a long talk, Christmas Day,
respecting of the Model.&nbsp; William is very sensible.&nbsp;
But sometimes cranky.&nbsp; William said, &lsquo;What will you do
with it, John?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;Patent
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; William said, &lsquo;How patent it,
John?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;By taking out a
Patent.&rsquo;&nbsp; William then delivered that the law of
Patent was a cruel wrong.&nbsp; William said, &lsquo;John, if you
make your invention public, before you get a Patent, any one may
rob you of the fruits of your hard work.&nbsp; You are put in a
cleft stick, John.&nbsp; Either you must drive a bargain very
much against yourself, by getting a party to come forward
beforehand with the great expenses of the Patent; or, you must be
put about, from post to pillar, among so many parties, trying to
make a better bargain for yourself, and showing your invention,
that your invention will be took from you over your
head.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;William Butcher, are you
cranky?&nbsp; You are sometimes cranky.&rsquo;&nbsp; William
said, &lsquo;No, John, I tell you the truth;&rsquo; which he then
delivered more at length.&nbsp; I said to W. B. I would Patent
the invention myself.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s brother, George Bury of West Bromwich (his
wife unfortunately took to drinking, made away with everything,
and seventeen times committed to Birmingham Jail before happy
release in every point of view), left my wife, his sister, when
he died, a legacy of one hundred and twenty-eight pound ten, Bank
of England Stocks.&nbsp; Me and my wife never broke into that
money yet.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; We might come to be old and past our
work.&nbsp; We now agreed to Patent the invention.&nbsp; We said
we would make a hole in it&mdash;I mean in the aforesaid
money&mdash;and Patent the invention.&nbsp; William Butcher wrote
me a letter to Thomas Joy, in London.&nbsp; T. J. is a carpenter,
six foot four in height, and plays quoits well.&nbsp; He lives in
Chelsea, London, by the church.&nbsp; I got leave from the shop,
to be took on again when I come back.&nbsp; I am a good
workman.&nbsp; Not a Teetotaller; but never drunk.&nbsp; When the
Christmas holidays were over, I went up to London by the
Parliamentary Train, and hired a lodging for a week with Thomas
Joy.&nbsp; He is married.&nbsp; He has one son gone to sea.</p>
<p>Thomas Joy delivered (from a book he had) that the first step
to be took, in Patenting the invention, was to prepare a petition
unto Queen Victoria.&nbsp; William Butcher had delivered similar,
and drawn it up.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; William is a ready
writer.&nbsp; A declaration before a Master in Chancery was to be
added to it.&nbsp; That, we likewise drew up.&nbsp; After a deal
of trouble I found out a Master, in Southampton Buildings,
Chancery Lane, nigh Temple Bar, where I made the declaration, and
paid eighteen-pence.&nbsp; I was told to take the declaration and
petition to the Home Office, in Whitehall, where I left it to be
signed by the Home Secretary (after I had found the office out),
and where I paid two pound, two, and sixpence.&nbsp; In six days
he signed it, and I was told to take it to the
Attorney-General&rsquo;s chambers, and leave it there for a
report.&nbsp; I did so, and paid four pound, four.&nbsp;
Note.&nbsp; Nobody all through, ever thankful for their money,
but all uncivil.</p>

</a></p>
<p>My lodging at Thomas Joy&rsquo;s was now hired for another
week, whereof five days were gone.&nbsp; The Attorney-General
made what they called a Report-of-course (my invention being, as
William Butcher had delivered before starting, unopposed), and I
was sent back with it to the Home Office.&nbsp; They made a Copy
of it, which was called a Warrant.&nbsp; For this warrant, I paid
seven pound, thirteen, and six.&nbsp; It was sent to the Queen,
to sign.&nbsp; The Queen sent it back, signed.&nbsp; The Home
Secretary signed it again.&nbsp; The gentleman throwed it at me
when I called, and said, &lsquo;Now take it to the Patent Office
in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was then in my third week
at Thomas Joy&rsquo;s living very sparing, on account of
fees.&nbsp; I found myself losing heart.</p>
<p>At the Patent Office in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, they made
&lsquo;a draft of the Queen&rsquo;s bill,&rsquo; of my invention,
and a &lsquo;docket of the bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; I paid five pound,
ten, and six, for this.&nbsp; They &lsquo;engrossed two copies of
the bill; one for the Signet Office, and one for the Privy-Seal
Office.&rsquo;&nbsp; I paid one pound, seven, and six, for
this.&nbsp; Stamp duty over and above, three pound.&nbsp; The
Engrossing Clerk of the same office engrossed the Queen&rsquo;s
bill for signature.&nbsp; I paid him one pound, one.&nbsp;
Stamp-duty, again, one pound, ten.&nbsp; I was next to take the
Queen&rsquo;s bill to the Attorney-General again, and get it
signed again.&nbsp; I took it, and paid five pound more.&nbsp; I
fetched it away, and took it to the Home Secretary again.&nbsp;
He sent it to the Queen again.&nbsp; She signed it again.&nbsp; I
paid seven pound, thirteen, and six, more, for this.&nbsp; I had
been over a month at Thomas Joy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I was quite wore
out, patience and pocket.</p>
<p>Thomas Joy delivered all this, as it went on, to William
Butcher.&nbsp; William Butcher delivered it again to three
Birmingham Parlours, from which it got to all the other Parlours,
and was took, as I have been told since, right through all the
shops in the North of England.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; William Butcher
delivered, at his Parlour, in a speech, that it was a Patent way
of making Chartists.</p>
<p>But I hadn&rsquo;t nigh done yet.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s bill
was to be took to the Signet Office in Somerset House,
Strand&mdash;where the stamp shop is.&nbsp; The Clerk of the
Signet made &lsquo;a Signet bill for the Lord Keeper of the Privy
Seal.&rsquo;&nbsp; I paid him four pound, seven.&nbsp; The Clerk
of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal made &lsquo;a Privy-Seal
bill for the Lord Chancellor.&rsquo;&nbsp; I paid him, four
pound, two.&nbsp; The Privy-Seal bill was handed over to the
Clerk of the Patents, who engrossed the aforesaid.&nbsp; I paid
him five pound, seventeen, and eight; at the same time, I paid
Stamp-duty for the Patent, in one lump, thirty pound.&nbsp; I
next paid for &lsquo;boxes for the Patent,&rsquo; nine and
sixpence.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; Thomas Joy would have made the same
at a profit for eighteen-pence.&nbsp; I next paid &lsquo;fees to
the Deputy, the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s Purse-bearer,&rsquo; two
pound, two.&nbsp; I next paid &lsquo;fees to the Clerk of the
Hanapar,&rsquo; seven pound, thirteen.&nbsp; I next paid
&lsquo;fees to the Deputy Clerk of the Hanaper,&rsquo; ten
shillings.&nbsp; I next paid, to the Lord Chancellor again, one
pound, eleven, and six.&nbsp; Last of all, I paid &lsquo;fees to
the Deputy Sealer, and Deputy Chaff-wax,&rsquo; ten shillings and
sixpence.&nbsp; I had lodged at Thomas Joy&rsquo;s over six
weeks, and the unopposed Patent for my invention, for England
only, had cost me ninety-six pound, seven, and eightpence.&nbsp;
If I had taken it out for the United Kingdom, it would have cost
me more than three hundred pound.</p>
<p>Now, teaching had not come up but very limited when I was
young.&nbsp; So much the worse for me you&rsquo;ll say.&nbsp; I
say the same.&nbsp; William Butcher is twenty year younger than
me.&nbsp; He knows a hundred year more.&nbsp; If William Butcher
had wanted to Patent an invention, he might have been sharper
than myself when hustled backwards and forwards among all those
offices, though I doubt if so patient.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; William
being sometimes cranky, and consider porters, messengers, and
clerks.</p>
<p>Thereby I say nothing of my being tired of my life, while I
was Patenting my invention.&nbsp; But I put this: Is it
reasonable to make a man feel as if, in inventing an ingenious
improvement meant to do good, he had done something wrong?&nbsp;
How else can a man feel, when he is met by such difficulties at
every turn?&nbsp; All inventors taking out a Patent <span
class="GutSmall">MUST</span> feel so.&nbsp; And look at the
expense.&nbsp; How hard on me, and how hard on the country if
there&rsquo;s any merit in me (and my invention is took up now, I
am thankful to say, and doing well), to put me to all that
expense before I can move a finger!&nbsp; Make the addition
yourself, and it&rsquo;ll come to ninety-six pound, seven, and
eightpence.&nbsp; No more, and no less.</p>
<p>What can I say against William Butcher, about places?&nbsp;
Look at the Home Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Patent
Office, the Engrossing Clerk, the Lord Chancellor, the Privy
Seal, the Clerk of the Patents, the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s
Purse-bearer, the Clerk of the Hanaper, the Deputy Clerk of the
Hanaper, the Deputy Sealer, and the Deputy Chaff-wax.&nbsp; No
man in England could get a Patent for an Indian-rubber band, or
an iron-hoop, without feeing all of them.&nbsp; Some of them,
over and over again.&nbsp; I went through thirty-five
stages.&nbsp; I began with the Queen upon the Throne.&nbsp; I
ended with the Deputy Chaff-wax.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; I should like
to see the Deputy Chaff-wax.&nbsp; Is it a man, or what is
it?</p>
<p>What I had to tell, I have told.&nbsp; I have wrote it
down.&nbsp; I hope it&rsquo;s plain.&nbsp; Not so much in the
handwriting (though nothing to boast of there), as in the sense
of it.&nbsp; I will now conclude with Thomas Joy.&nbsp; Thomas
said to me, when we parted, &lsquo;John, if the laws of this
country were as honest as they ought to be, you would have come
to London&mdash;registered an exact description and drawing of
your invention&mdash;paid half-a-crown or so for doing of
it&mdash;and therein and thereby have got your Patent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My opinion is the same as Thomas Joy.&nbsp; Further.&nbsp; In
William Butcher&rsquo;s delivering &lsquo;that the whole gang of
Hanapers and Chaff-waxes must be done away with, and that England
has been chaffed and waxed sufficient,&rsquo; I agree.</p>
<h2><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>THE
NOBLE SAVAGE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> come to the point at once, I beg
to say that I have not the least belief in the Noble
Savage.&nbsp; I consider him a prodigious nuisance, and an
enormous superstition.&nbsp; His calling rum fire-water, and me a
pale face, wholly fail to reconcile me to him.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care what he calls me.&nbsp; I call him a savage, and
I call a savage a something highly desirable to be civilised off
the face of the earth.&nbsp; I think a mere gent (which I take to
be the lowest form of civilisation) better than a howling,
whistling, clucking, stamping, jumping, tearing savage.&nbsp; It
is all one to me, whether he sticks a fish-bone through his
visage, or bits of trees through the lobes of his ears, or
bird&rsquo;s feathers in his head; whether he flattens his hair
between two boards, or spreads his nose over the breadth of his
face, or drags his lower lip down by great weights, or blackens
his teeth, or knocks them out, or paints one cheek red and the
other blue, or tattoos himself, or oils himself, or rubs his body
with fat, or crimps it with knives.&nbsp; Yielding to whichsoever
of these agreeable eccentricities, he is a savage&mdash;cruel,
false, thievish, murderous; addicted more or less to grease,
entrails, and beastly customs; a wild animal with the
questionable gift of boasting; a conceited, tiresome,
bloodthirsty, monotonous humbug.</p>
<p>Yet it is extraordinary to observe how some people will talk
about him, as they talk about the good old times; how they will
regret his disappearance, in the course of this world&rsquo;s
development, from such and such lands where his absence is a
blessed relief and an indispensable preparation for the sowing of
the very first seeds of any influence that can exalt humanity;
how, even with the evidence of himself before them, they will
either be determined to believe, or will suffer themselves to be
persuaded into believing, that he is something which their five
senses tell them he is not.</p>
<p>There was Mr. Catlin, some few years ago, with his Ojibbeway
Indians.&nbsp; Mr. Catlin was an energetic, earnest man, who had
lived among more tribes of Indians than I need reckon up here,
and who had written a picturesque and glowing book about
them.&nbsp; With his party of Indians squatting and spitting on
the table before him, or dancing their miserable jigs after their
own dreary manner, he called, in all good faith, upon his
civilised audience to take notice of their symmetry and grace,
their perfect limbs, and the exquisite expression of their
pantomime; and his civilised audience, in all good faith,
complied and admired.&nbsp; Whereas, as mere animals, they were
wretched creatures, very low in the scale and very poorly formed;
and as men and women possessing any power of truthful dramatic
expression by means of action, they were no better than the
chorus at an Italian Opera in England&mdash;and would have been
worse if such a thing were possible.</p>
<p>Mine are no new views of the noble savage.&nbsp; The greatest
writers on natural history found him out long ago.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Buffon</span> knew what he was, and showed why he
is the sulky tyrant that he is to his women, and how it happens
(Heaven be praised!) that his race is spare in numbers.&nbsp; For
evidence of the quality of his moral nature, pass himself for a
moment and refer to his &lsquo;faithful dog.&rsquo;&nbsp; Has he
ever improved a dog, or attached a dog, since his nobility first
ran wild in woods, and was brought down (at a very long shot) by
<span class="smcap">Pope</span>?&nbsp; Or does the animal that is
the friend of man, always degenerate in his low society?</p>
<p>It is not the miserable nature of the noble savage that is the
new thing; it is the whimpering over him with maudlin admiration,
and the affecting to regret him, and the drawing of any
comparison of advantage between the blemishes of civilisation and
the tenor of his swinish life.&nbsp; There may have been a change
now and then in those diseased absurdities, but there is none in
him.</p>
<p>Think of the Bushmen.&nbsp; Think of the two men and the two
women who have been exhibited about England for some years.&nbsp;
Are the majority of persons&mdash;who remember the horrid little
leader of that party in his festering bundle of hides, with his
filth and his antipathy to water, and his straddled legs, and his
odious eyes shaded by his brutal hand, and his cry of
&lsquo;Qu-u-u-u-aaa!&rsquo; (Bosjesman for something desperately
insulting I have no doubt)&mdash;conscious of an affectionate
yearning towards that noble savage, or is it idiosyncratic in me
to abhor, detest, abominate, and abjure him?&nbsp; I have no
reserve on this subject, and will frankly state that, setting
aside that stage of the entertainment when he counterfeited the
death of some creature he had shot, by laying his head on his
hand and shaking his left leg&mdash;at which time I think it
would have been justifiable homicide to slay him&mdash;I have
never seen that group sleeping, smoking, and expectorating round
their brazier, but I have sincerely desired that something might
happen to the charcoal smouldering therein, which would cause the
immediate suffocation of the whole of the noble strangers.</p>
<p>There is at present a party of Zulu Kaffirs exhibiting at the
St. George&rsquo;s Gallery, Hyde Park Corner, London.&nbsp; These
noble savages are represented in a most agreeable manner; they
are seen in an elegant theatre, fitted with appropriate scenery
of great beauty, and they are described in a very sensible and
unpretending lecture, delivered with a modesty which is quite a
pattern to all similar exponents.&nbsp; Though extremely ugly,
they are much better shaped than such of their predecessors as I
have referred to; and they are rather picturesque to the eye,
though far from odoriferous to the nose.&nbsp; What a visitor
left to his own interpretings and imaginings might suppose these
noblemen to be about, when they give vent to that pantomimic
expression which is quite settled to be the natural gift of the
noble savage, I cannot possibly conceive; for it is so much too
luminous for my personal civilisation that it conveys no idea to
my mind beyond a general stamping, ramping, and raving,
remarkable (as everything in savage life is) for its dire
uniformity.&nbsp; But let us&mdash;with the interpreter&rsquo;s
assistance, of which I for one stand so much in need&mdash;see
what the noble savage does in Zulu Kaffirland.</p>
<p>The noble savage sets a king to reign over him, to whom he
submits his life and limbs without a murmur or question, and
whose whole life is passed chin deep in a lake of blood; but who,
after killing incessantly, is in his turn killed by his relations
and friends, the moment a grey hair appears on his head.&nbsp;
All the noble savage&rsquo;s wars with his fellow-savages (and he
takes no pleasure in anything else) are wars of
extermination&mdash;which is the best thing I know of him, and
the most comfortable to my mind when I look at him.&nbsp; He has
no moral feelings of any kind, sort, or description; and his
&lsquo;mission&rsquo; may be summed up as simply diabolical.</p>
<p>The ceremonies with which he faintly diversifies his life are,
of course, of a kindred nature.&nbsp; If he wants a wife he
appears before the kennel of the gentleman whom he has selected
for his father-in-law, attended by a party of male friends of a
very strong flavour, who screech and whistle and stamp an offer
of so many cows for the young lady&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; The chosen
father-in-law&mdash;also supported by a high-flavoured party of
male friends&mdash;screeches, whistles, and yells (being seated
on the ground, he can&rsquo;t stamp) that there never was such a
daughter in the market as his daughter, and that he must have six
more cows.&nbsp; The son-in-law and his select circle of backers
screech, whistle, stamp, and yell in reply, that they will give
three more cows.&nbsp; The father-in-law (an old deluder,
overpaid at the beginning) accepts four, and rises to bind the
bargain.&nbsp; The whole party, the young lady included, then
falling into epileptic convulsions, and screeching, whistling,
stamping, and yelling together&mdash;and nobody taking any notice
of the young lady (whose charms are not to be thought of without
a shudder)&mdash;the noble savage is considered married, and his
friends make demoniacal leaps at him by way of
congratulation.</p>
<p>When the noble savage finds himself a little unwell, and
mentions the circumstance to his friends, it is immediately
perceived that he is under the influence of witchcraft.&nbsp; A
learned personage, called an Imyanger or Witch Doctor, is
immediately sent for to Nooker the Umtargartie, or smell out the
witch.&nbsp; The male inhabitants of the kraal being seated on
the ground, the learned doctor, got up like a grizzly bear,
appears, and administers a dance of a most terrific nature,
during the exhibition of which remedy he incessantly gnashes his
teeth, and howls:&mdash;&lsquo;I am the original physician to
Nooker the Umtargartie.&nbsp; Yow yow yow!&nbsp; No connexion
with any other establishment.&nbsp; Till till till!&nbsp; All
other Umtargarties are feigned Umtargarties, Boroo Boroo! but I
perceive here a genuine and real Umtargartie, Hoosh Hoosh Hoosh!
in whose blood I, the original Imyanger and Nookerer, Blizzerum
Boo! will wash these bear&rsquo;s claws of mine.&nbsp; O yow yow
yow!&rsquo;&nbsp; All this time the learned physician is looking
out among the attentive faces for some unfortunate man who owes
him a cow, or who has given him any small offence, or against
whom, without offence, he has conceived a spite.&nbsp; Him he
never fails to Nooker as the Umtargartie, and he is instantly
killed.&nbsp; In the absence of such an individual, the usual
practice is to Nooker the quietest and most gentlemanly person in
company.&nbsp; But the nookering is invariably followed on the
spot by the butchering.</p>
<p>Some of the noble savages in whom Mr. Catlin was so strongly
interested, and the diminution of whose numbers, by rum and
smallpox, greatly affected him, had a custom not unlike this,
though much more appalling and disgusting in its odious
details.</p>
<p>The women being at work in the fields, hoeing the Indian corn,
and the noble savage being asleep in the shade, the chief has
sometimes the condescension to come forth, and lighten the labour
by looking at it.&nbsp; On these occasions, he seats himself in
his own savage chair, and is attended by his shield-bearer: who
holds over his head a shield of cowhide&mdash;in shape like an
immense mussel shell&mdash;fearfully and wonderfully, after the
manner of a theatrical supernumerary.&nbsp; But lest the great
man should forget his greatness in the contemplation of the
humble works of agriculture, there suddenly rushes in a poet,
retained for the purpose, called a Praiser.&nbsp; This literary
gentleman wears a leopard&rsquo;s head over his own, and a dress
of tigers&rsquo; tails; he has the appearance of having come
express on his hind legs from the Zoological Gardens; and he
incontinently strikes up the chief&rsquo;s praises, plunging and
tearing all the while.&nbsp; There is a frantic wickedness in
this brute&rsquo;s manner of worrying the air, and gnashing out,
&lsquo;O what a delightful chief he is!&nbsp; O what a delicious
quantity of blood he sheds!&nbsp; O how majestically he laps it
up!&nbsp; O how charmingly cruel he is!&nbsp; O how he tears the
flesh of his enemies and crunches the bones!&nbsp; O how like the
tiger and the leopard and the wolf and the bear he is!&nbsp; O,
row row row row, how fond I am of him!&rsquo; which might tempt
the Society of Friends to charge at a hand-gallop into the
Swartz-Kop location and exterminate the whole kraal.</p>
<p>When war is afoot among the noble savages&mdash;which is
always&mdash;the chief holds a council to ascertain whether it is
the opinion of his brothers and friends in general that the enemy
shall be exterminated.&nbsp; On this occasion, after the
performance of an Umsebeuza, or war song,&mdash;which is exactly
like all the other songs,&mdash;the chief makes a speech to his
brothers and friends, arranged in single file.&nbsp; No
particular order is observed during the delivery of this address,
but every gentleman who finds himself excited by the subject,
instead of crying &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo; as is the custom with
us, darts from the rank and tramples out the life, or crushes the
skull, or mashes the face, or scoops out the eyes, or breaks the
limbs, or performs a whirlwind of atrocities on the body, of an
imaginary enemy.&nbsp; Several gentlemen becoming thus excited at
once, and pounding away without the least regard to the orator,
that illustrious person is rather in the position of an orator in
an Irish House of Commons.&nbsp; But, several of these scenes of
savage life bear a strong generic resemblance to an Irish
election, and I think would be extremely well received and
understood at Cork.</p>
<p>In all these ceremonies the noble savage holds forth to the
utmost possible extent about himself; from which (to turn him to
some civilised account) we may learn, I think, that as egotism is
one of the most offensive and contemptible littlenesses a
civilised man can exhibit, so it is really incompatible with the
interchange of ideas; inasmuch as if we all talked about
ourselves we should soon have no listeners, and must be all
yelling and screeching at once on our own separate accounts:
making society hideous.&nbsp; It is my opinion that if we
retained in us anything of the noble savage, we could not get rid
of it too soon.&nbsp; But the fact is clearly otherwise.&nbsp;
Upon the wife and dowry question, substituting coin for cows, we
have assuredly nothing of the Zulu Kaffir left.&nbsp; The
endurance of despotism is one great distinguishing mark of a
savage always.&nbsp; The improving world has quite got the better
of that too.&nbsp; In like manner, Paris is a civilised city, and
the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais a highly civilised
theatre; and we shall never hear, and never have heard in these
later days (of course) of the Praiser there.&nbsp; No, no,
civilised poets have better work to do.&nbsp; As to Nookering
Umtargarties, there are no pretended Umtargarties in Europe, and
no European powers to Nooker them; that would be mere spydom,
subordination, small malice, superstition, and false
pretence.&nbsp; And as to private Umtargarties, are we not in the
year eighteen hundred and fifty-three, with spirits rapping at
our doors?</p>
<p>To conclude as I began.&nbsp; My position is, that if we have
anything to learn from the Noble Savage, it is what to
avoid.&nbsp; His virtues are a fable; his happiness is a
delusion; his nobility, nonsense.</p>
<p>We have no greater justification for being cruel to the
miserable object, than for being cruel to a <span
class="smcap">William Shakespeare</span> or an <span
class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span>; but he passes away before an
immeasurably better and higher power than ever ran wild in any
earthly woods, and the world will be all the better when his
place knows him no more.</p>
<h2><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>A
FLIGHT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Don Diego de&mdash;I forget
his name&mdash;the inventor of the last new Flying Machines,
price so many francs for ladies, so many more for
gentlemen&mdash;when Don Diego, by permission of Deputy Chaff-wax
and his noble band, shall have taken out a Patent for the
Queen&rsquo;s dominions, and shall have opened a commodious
Warehouse in an airy situation; and when all persons of any
gentility will keep at least a pair of wings, and be seen
skimming about in every direction; I shall take a flight to Paris
(as I soar round the world) in a cheap and independent
manner.&nbsp; At present, my reliance is on the South-Eastern
Railway Company, in whose Express Train here I sit, at eight of
the clock on a very hot morning, under the very hot roof of the
Terminus at London Bridge, in danger of being
&lsquo;forced&rsquo; like a cucumber or a melon, or a
pine-apple.&nbsp; And talking of pine-apples, I suppose there
never were so many pine-apples in a Train as there appear to be
in this Train.</p>
<p>Whew!&nbsp; The hot-house air is faint with pine-apples.&nbsp;
Every French citizen or citizeness is carrying pine-apples
home.&nbsp; The compact little Enchantress in the corner of my
carriage (French actress, to whom I yielded up my heart under the
auspices of that brave child, &lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Meat-chell</span>,&rsquo; at the St. James&rsquo;s
Theatre the night before last) has a pine-apple in her lap.&nbsp;
Compact Enchantress&rsquo;s friend, confidante, mother, mystery,
Heaven knows what, has two pine-apples in her lap, and a bundle
of them under the seat.&nbsp; Tobacco-smoky Frenchman in Algerine
wrapper, with peaked hood behind, who might be Abd-el-Kader dyed
rifle-green, and who seems to be dressed entirely in dirt and
braid, carries pine-apples in a covered basket.&nbsp; Tall,
grave, melancholy Frenchman, with black Vandyke beard, and hair
close-cropped, with expansive chest to waistcoat, and compressive
waist to coat: saturnine as to his pantaloons, calm as to his
feminine boots, precious as to his jewellery, smooth and white as
to his linen: dark-eyed, high-foreheaded, hawk-nosed&mdash;got
up, one thinks, like Lucifer or Mephistopheles, or Zamiel,
transformed into a highly genteel Parisian&mdash;has the green
end of a pine-apple sticking out of his neat valise.</p>
<p>Whew!&nbsp; If I were to be kept here long, under this
forcing-frame, I wonder what would become of me&mdash;whether I
should be forced into a giant, or should sprout or blow into some
other phenomenon!&nbsp; Compact Enchantress is not ruffled by the
heat&mdash;she is always composed, always compact.&nbsp; O look
at her little ribbons, frills, and edges, at her shawl, at her
gloves, at her hair, at her bracelets, at her bonnet, at
everything about her!&nbsp; How is it accomplished?&nbsp; What
does she do to be so neat?&nbsp; How is it that every trifle she
wears belongs to her, and cannot choose but be a part of
her?&nbsp; And even Mystery, look at <i>her</i>!&nbsp; A
model.&nbsp; Mystery is not young, not pretty, though still of an
average candle-light passability; but she does such miracles in
her own behalf, that, one of these days, when she dies,
they&rsquo;ll be amazed to find an old woman in her bed,
distantly like her.&nbsp; She was an actress once, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, and had a Mystery attendant on
herself.&nbsp; Perhaps, Compact Enchantress will live to be a
Mystery, and to wait with a shawl at the side-scenes, and to sit
opposite to Mademoiselle in railway carriages, and smile and talk
subserviently, as Mystery does now.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s hard to
believe!</p>
<p>Two Englishmen, and now our carriage is full.&nbsp; First
Englishman, in the monied interest&mdash;flushed, highly
respectable&mdash;Stock Exchange, perhaps&mdash;City,
certainly.&nbsp; Faculties of second Englishman entirely absorbed
in hurry.&nbsp; Plunges into the carriage, blind.&nbsp; Calls out
of window concerning his luggage, deaf.&nbsp; Suffocates himself
under pillows of great-coats, for no reason, and in a demented
manner.&nbsp; Will receive no assurance from any porter
whatsoever.&nbsp; Is stout and hot, and wipes his head, and makes
himself hotter by breathing so hard.&nbsp; Is totally incredulous
respecting assurance of Collected Guard, that
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s no hurry.&rsquo;&nbsp; No hurry!&nbsp; And a
flight to Paris in eleven hours!</p>
<p>It is all one to me in this drowsy corner, hurry or no
hurry.&nbsp; Until Don Diego shall send home my wings, my flight
is with the South-Eastern Company.&nbsp; I can fly with the
South-Eastern, more lazily, at all events, than in the upper
air.&nbsp; I have but to sit here thinking as idly as I please,
and be whisked away.&nbsp; I am not accountable to anybody for
the idleness of my thoughts in such an idle summer flight; my
flight is provided for by the South-Eastern and is no business of
mine.</p>
<p>The bell!&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; It does not require
me to do so much as even to flap my wings.&nbsp; Something snorts
for me, something shrieks for me, something proclaims to
everything else that it had better keep out of my way,&mdash;and
away I go.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; The fresh air is pleasant after the forcing-frame,
though it does blow over these interminable streets, and scatter
the smoke of this vast wilderness of chimneys.&nbsp; Here we
are&mdash;no, I mean there we were, for it has darted far into
the rear&mdash;in Bermondsey where the tanners live.&nbsp;
Flash!&nbsp; The distant shipping in the Thames is gone.&nbsp;
Whirr!&nbsp; The little streets of new brick and red tile, with
here and there a flagstaff growing like a tall weed out of the
scarlet beans, and, everywhere, plenty of open sewer and ditch
for the promotion of the public health, have been fired off in a
volley.&nbsp; Whizz!&nbsp; Dust-heaps, market-gardens, and waste
grounds.&nbsp; Rattle!&nbsp; New Cross Station.&nbsp;
Shock!&nbsp; There we were at Croydon.&nbsp; Bur-r-r-r!&nbsp; The
tunnel.</p>
<p>I wonder why it is that when I shut my eyes in a tunnel I
begin to feel as if I were going at an Express pace the other
way.&nbsp; I am clearly going back to London now.&nbsp; Compact
Enchantress must have forgotten something, and reversed the
engine.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; After long darkness, pale fitful streaks
of light appear.&nbsp; I am still flying on for Folkestone.&nbsp;
The streaks grow stronger&mdash;become continuous&mdash;become
the ghost of day&mdash;become the living day&mdash;became I
mean&mdash;the tunnel is miles and miles away, and here I fly
through sunlight, all among the harvest and the Kentish hops.</p>
<p>There is a dreamy pleasure in this flying.&nbsp; I wonder
where it was, and when it was, that we exploded, blew into space
somehow, a Parliamentary Train, with a crowd of heads and faces
looking at us out of cages, and some hats waving.&nbsp; Monied
Interest says it was at Reigate Station.&nbsp; Expounds to
Mystery how Reigate Station is so many miles from London, which
Mystery again develops to Compact Enchantress.&nbsp; There might
be neither a Reigate nor a London for me, as I fly away among the
Kentish hops and harvest.&nbsp; What do <i>I</i> care?</p>
<p>Bang!&nbsp; We have let another Station off, and fly away
regardless.&nbsp; Everything is flying.&nbsp; The hop-gardens
turn gracefully towards me, presenting regular avenues of hops in
rapid flight, then whirl away.&nbsp; So do the pools and rushes,
haystacks, sheep, clover in full bloom delicious to the sight and
smell, corn-sheaves, cherry-orchards, apple-orchards, reapers,
gleaners, hedges, gates, fields that taper off into little
angular corners, cottages, gardens, now and then a church.&nbsp;
Bang, bang!&nbsp; A double-barrelled Station!&nbsp; Now a wood,
now a bridge, now a landscape, now a cutting, now a&mdash;Bang! a
single-barrelled Station&mdash;there was a cricket-match
somewhere with two white tents, and then four flying cows, then
turnips&mdash;now the wires of the electric telegraph are all
alive, and spin, and blurr their edges, and go up and down, and
make the intervals between each other most irregular: contracting
and expanding in the strangest manner.&nbsp; Now we
slacken.&nbsp; With a screwing, and a grinding, and a smell of
water thrown on ashes, now we stop!</p>
<p>Demented Traveller, who has been for two or three minutes
watchful, clutches his great-coats, plunges at the door, rattles
it, cries &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; eager to embark on board of
impossible packets, far inland.&nbsp; Collected Guard
appears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you for Tunbridge, sir?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tunbridge?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Paris.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Plenty of time, sir.&nbsp; No hurry.&nbsp; Five minutes
here, sir, for refreshment.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am so blest
(anticipating Zamiel, by half a second) as to procure a glass of
water for Compact Enchantress.</p>
<p>Who would suppose we had been flying at such a rate, and shall
take wing again directly?&nbsp; Refreshment-room full, platform
full, porter with watering-pot deliberately cooling a hot wheel,
another porter with equal deliberation helping the rest of the
wheels bountifully to ice cream.&nbsp; Monied Interest and I
re-entering the carriage first, and being there alone, he
intimates to me that the French are &lsquo;no go&rsquo; as a
Nation.&nbsp; I ask why?&nbsp; He says, that Reign of Terror of
theirs was quite enough.&nbsp; I ventured to inquire whether he
remembers anything that preceded said Reign of Terror?&nbsp; He
says not particularly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; I remark,
&lsquo;the harvest that is reaped, has sometimes been
sown.&rsquo;&nbsp; Monied Interest repeats, as quite enough for
him, that the French are revolutionary,&mdash;&lsquo;and always
at it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bell.&nbsp; Compact Enchantress, helped in by Zamiel (whom the
stars confound!), gives us her charming little side-box look, and
smites me to the core.&nbsp; Mystery eating sponge-cake.&nbsp;
Pine-apple atmosphere faintly tinged with suspicions of
sherry.&nbsp; Demented Traveller flits past the carriage, looking
for it.&nbsp; Is blind with agitation, and can&rsquo;t see
it.&nbsp; Seems singled out by Destiny to be the only unhappy
creature in the flight, who has any cause to hurry himself.&nbsp;
Is nearly left behind.&nbsp; Is seized by Collected Guard after
the Train is in motion, and bundled in.&nbsp; Still, has
lingering suspicions that there must be a boat in the
neighbourhood, and will look wildly out of window for it.</p>
<p>Flight resumed.&nbsp; Corn-sheaves, hop-gardens, reapers,
gleaners, apple-orchards, cherry-orchards, Stations single and
double-barrelled, Ashford.&nbsp; Compact Enchantress (constantly
talking to Mystery, in an exquisite manner) gives a little
scream; a sound that seems to come from high up in her precious
little head; from behind her bright little eyebrows.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Great Heaven, my pine-apple!&nbsp; My Angel!&nbsp; It is
lost!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mystery is desolated.&nbsp; A search
made.&nbsp; It is not lost.&nbsp; Zamiel finds it.&nbsp; I curse
him (flying) in the Persian manner.&nbsp; May his face be turned
upside down, and jackasses sit upon his uncle&rsquo;s grave!</p>
<p>Now fresher air, now glimpses of unenclosed Down-land with
flapping crows flying over it whom we soon outfly, now the Sea,
now Folkestone at a quarter after ten.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tickets
ready, gentlemen!&rsquo;&nbsp; Demented dashes at the door.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For Paris, sir?&nbsp; No hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not the least.&nbsp; We are dropped slowly down to the Port,
and sidle to and fro (the whole Train) before the insensible
Royal George Hotel, for some ten minutes.&nbsp; The Royal George
takes no more heed of us than its namesake under water at
Spithead, or under earth at Windsor, does.&nbsp; The Royal
George&rsquo;s dog lies winking and blinking at us, without
taking the trouble to sit up; and the Royal George&rsquo;s
&lsquo;wedding party&rsquo; at the open window (who seem, I must
say, rather tired of bliss) don&rsquo;t bestow a solitary glance
upon us, flying thus to Paris in eleven hours.&nbsp; The first
gentleman in Folkestone is evidently used up, on this
subject.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Demented chafes.&nbsp; Conceives that every
man&rsquo;s hand is against him, and exerting itself to prevent
his getting to Paris.&nbsp; Refuses consolation.&nbsp; Rattles
door.&nbsp; Sees smoke on the horizon, and &lsquo;knows&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s the boat gone without him.&nbsp; Monied Interest
resentfully explains that <i>he</i> is going to Paris too.&nbsp;
Demented signifies, that if Monied Interest chooses to be left
behind, he don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Refreshments in the Waiting-Room, ladies and
gentlemen.&nbsp; No hurry, ladies and gentlemen, for Paris.&nbsp;
No hurry whatever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes&rsquo; pause, by Folkestone clock, for looking
at Enchantress while she eats a sandwich, and at Mystery while
she eats of everything there that is eatable, from pork-pie,
sausage, jam, and gooseberries, to lumps of sugar.&nbsp; All this
time, there is a very waterfall of luggage, with a spray of dust,
tumbling slantwise from the pier into the steamboat.&nbsp; All
this time, Demented (who has no business with it) watches it with
starting eyes, fiercely requiring to be shown his luggage.&nbsp;
When it at last concludes the cataract, he rushes hotly to
refresh&mdash;is shouted after, pursued, jostled, brought back,
pitched into the departing steamer upside down, and caught by
mariners disgracefully.</p>
<p>A lovely harvest-day, a cloudless sky, a tranquil sea.&nbsp;
The piston-rods of the engines so regularly coming up from below,
to look (as well they may) at the bright weather, and so
regularly almost knocking their iron heads against the cross beam
of the skylight, and never doing it!&nbsp; Another Parisian
actress is on board, attended by another Mystery.&nbsp; Compact
Enchantress greets her sister artist&mdash;Oh, the Compact
One&rsquo;s pretty teeth!&mdash;and Mystery greets Mystery.&nbsp;
<i>My</i> Mystery soon ceases to be conversational&mdash;is taken
poorly, in a word, having lunched too miscellaneously&mdash;and
goes below.&nbsp; The remaining Mystery then smiles upon the
sister artists (who, I am afraid, wouldn&rsquo;t greatly mind
stabbing each other), and is upon the whole ravished.</p>
<p>And now I find that all the French people on board begin to
grow, and all the English people to shrink.&nbsp; The French are
nearing home, and shaking off a disadvantage, whereas we are
shaking it on.&nbsp; Zamiel is the same man, and Abd-el-Kader is
the same man, but each seems to come into possession of an
indescribable confidence that departs from us&mdash;from Monied
Interest, for instance, and from me.&nbsp; Just what they gain,
we lose.&nbsp; Certain British &lsquo;Gents&rsquo; about the
steersman, intellectually nurtured at home on parody of
everything and truth of nothing, become subdued, and in a manner
forlorn; and when the steersman tells them (not exultingly) how
he has &lsquo;been upon this station now eight year, and never
see the old town of Bullum yet,&rsquo; one of them, with an
imbecile reliance on a reed, asks him what he considers to be the
best hotel in Paris?</p>
<p>Now, I tread upon French ground, and am greeted by the three
charming words, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, painted up (in
letters a little too thin for their height) on the Custom-house
wall&mdash;also by the sight of large cocked hats, without which
demonstrative head-gear nothing of a public nature can be done
upon this soil.&nbsp; All the rabid Hotel population of Boulogne
howl and shriek outside a distant barrier, frantic to get at
us.&nbsp; Demented, by some unlucky means peculiar to himself, is
delivered over to their fury, and is presently seen struggling in
a whirlpool of Touters&mdash;is somehow understood to be going to
Paris&mdash;is, with infinite noise, rescued by two cocked hats,
and brought into Custom-house bondage with the rest of us.</p>
<p>Here, I resign the active duties of life to an eager being, of
preternatural sharpness, with a shelving forehead and a shabby
snuff-coloured coat, who (from the wharf) brought me down with
his eye before the boat came into port.&nbsp; He darts upon my
luggage, on the floor where all the luggage is strewn like a
wreck at the bottom of the great deep; gets it proclaimed and
weighed as the property of &lsquo;Monsieur a traveller
unknown;&rsquo; pays certain francs for it, to a certain
functionary behind a Pigeon Hole, like a pay-box at a Theatre
(the arrangements in general are on a wholesale scale, half
military and half theatrical); and I suppose I shall find it when
I come to Paris&mdash;he says I shall.&nbsp; I know nothing about
it, except that I pay him his small fee, and pocket the ticket he
gives me, and sit upon a counter, involved in the general
distraction.</p>
<p>Railway station.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lunch or dinner, ladies and
gentlemen.&nbsp; Plenty of time for Paris.&nbsp; Plenty of
time!&rsquo;&nbsp; Large hall, long counter, long strips of
dining-table, bottles of wine, plates of meat, roast chickens,
little loaves of bread, basins of soup, little caraffes of
brandy, cakes, and fruit.&nbsp; Comfortably restored from these
resources, I begin to fly again.</p>
<p>I saw Zamiel (before I took wing) presented to Compact
Enchantress and Sister Artist, by an officer in uniform, with a
waist like a wasp&rsquo;s, and pantaloons like two
balloons.&nbsp; They all got into the next carriage together,
accompanied by the two Mysteries.&nbsp; They laughed.&nbsp; I am
alone in the carriage (for I don&rsquo;t consider Demented
anybody) and alone in the world.</p>
<p>Fields, windmills, low grounds, pollard-trees, windmills,
fields, fortifications, Abbeville, soldiering and drumming.&nbsp;
I wonder where England is, and when I was there last&mdash;about
two years ago, I should say.&nbsp; Flying in and out among these
trenches and batteries, skimming the clattering drawbridges,
looking down into the stagnant ditches, I become a prisoner of
state, escaping.&nbsp; I am confined with a comrade in a
fortress.&nbsp; Our room is in an upper story.&nbsp; We have
tried to get up the chimney, but there&rsquo;s an iron grating
across it, imbedded in the masonry.&nbsp; After months of labour,
we have worked the grating loose with the poker, and can lift it
up.&nbsp; We have also made a hook, and twisted our rugs and
blankets into ropes.&nbsp; Our plan is, to go up the chimney,
hook our ropes to the top, descend hand over hand upon the roof
of the guard-house far below, shake the hook loose, watch the
opportunity of the sentinels pacing away, hook again, drop into
the ditch, swim across it, creep into the shelter of the
wood.&nbsp; The time is come&mdash;a wild and stormy night.&nbsp;
We are up the chimney, we are on the guard-house roof, we are
swimming in the murky ditch, when lo!&nbsp; &lsquo;Qui
v&rsquo;l&agrave;?&rsquo; a bugle, the alarm, a crash!&nbsp; What
is it?&nbsp; Death?&nbsp; No, Amiens.</p>
<p>More fortifications, more soldiering and drumming, more basins
of soup, more little loaves of bread, more bottles of wine, more
caraffes of brandy, more time for refreshment.&nbsp; Everything
good, and everything ready.&nbsp; Bright, unsubstantial-looking,
scenic sort of station.&nbsp; People waiting.&nbsp; Houses,
uniforms, beards, moustaches, some sabots, plenty of neat women,
and a few old-visaged children.&nbsp; Unless it be a delusion
born of my giddy flight, the grown-up people and the children
seem to change places in France.&nbsp; In general, the boys and
girls are little old men and women, and the men and women lively
boys and girls.</p>
<p>Bugle, shriek, flight resumed.&nbsp; Monied Interest has come
into my carriage.&nbsp; Says the manner of refreshing is
&lsquo;not bad,&rsquo; but considers it French.&nbsp; Admits
great dexterity and politeness in the attendants.&nbsp; Thinks a
decimal currency may have something to do with their despatch in
settling accounts, and don&rsquo;t know but what it&rsquo;s
sensible and convenient.&nbsp; Adds, however, as a general
protest, that they&rsquo;re a revolutionary people&mdash;and
always at it.</p>
<p>Ramparts, canals, cathedral, river, soldiering and drumming,
open country, river, earthenware manufactures, Creil.&nbsp; Again
ten minutes.&nbsp; Not even Demented in a hurry.&nbsp; Station, a
drawing-room with a verandah: like a planter&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
Monied Interest considers it a band-box, and not made to
last.&nbsp; Little round tables in it, at one of which the Sister
Artists and attendant Mysteries are established with Wasp and
Zamiel, as if they were going to stay a week.</p>
<p>Anon, with no more trouble than before, I am flying again, and
lazily wondering as I fly.&nbsp; What has the South-Eastern done
with all the horrible little villages we used to pass through, in
the <i>Diligence</i>?&nbsp; What have they done with all the
summer dust, with all the winter mud, with all the dreary avenues
of little trees, with all the ramshackle postyards, with all the
beggars (who used to turn out at night with bits of lighted
candle, to look in at the coach windows), with all the
long-tailed horses who were always biting one another, with all
the big postilions in jack-boots&mdash;with all the mouldy
caf&eacute;s that we used to stop at, where a long mildewed
table-cloth, set forth with jovial bottles of vinegar and oil,
and with a Siamese arrangement of pepper and salt, was never
wanting?&nbsp; Where are the grass-grown little towns, the
wonderful little market-places all unconscious of markets, the
shops that nobody kept, the streets that nobody trod, the
churches that nobody went to, the bells that nobody rang, the
tumble-down old buildings plastered with many-coloured bills that
nobody read?&nbsp; Where are the two-and-twenty weary hours of
long, long day and night journey, sure to be either insupportably
hot or insupportably cold?&nbsp; Where are the pains in my bones,
where are the fidgets in my legs, where is the Frenchman with the
nightcap who never <i>would</i> have the little
coup&eacute;-window down, and who always fell upon me when he
went to sleep, and always slept all night snoring onions?</p>
<p>A voice breaks in with &lsquo;Paris!&nbsp; Here we
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have overflown myself, perhaps, but I can&rsquo;t believe
it.&nbsp; I feel as if I were enchanted or bewitched.&nbsp; It is
barely eight o&rsquo;clock yet&mdash;it is nothing like
half-past&mdash;when I have had my luggage examined at that
briskest of Custom-houses attached to the station, and am
rattling over the pavement in a hackney-cabriolet.</p>
<p>Surely, not the pavement of Paris?&nbsp; Yes, I think it is,
too.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know any other place where there are all
these high houses, all these haggard-looking wine shops, all
these billiard tables, all these stocking-makers with flat red or
yellow legs of wood for signboard, all these fuel shops with
stacks of billets painted outside, and real billets sawing in the
gutter, all these dirty corners of streets, all these cabinet
pictures over dark doorways representing discreet matrons nursing
babies.&nbsp; And yet this morning&mdash;I&rsquo;ll think of it
in a warm-bath.</p>
<p>Very like a small room that I remember in the Chinese baths
upon the Boulevard, certainly; and, though I see it through the
steam, I think that I might swear to that peculiar hot-linen
basket, like a large wicker hour-glass.&nbsp; When can it have
been that I left home?&nbsp; When was it that I paid
&lsquo;through to Paris&rsquo; at London Bridge, and discharged
myself of all responsibility, except the preservation of a
voucher ruled into three divisions, of which the first was
snipped off at Folkestone, the second aboard the boat, and the
third taken at my journey&rsquo;s end?&nbsp; It seems to have
been ages ago.&nbsp; Calculation is useless.&nbsp; I will go out
for a walk.</p>
<p>The crowds in the streets, the lights in the shops and
balconies, the elegance, variety, and beauty of their
decorations, the number of the theatres, the brilliant
caf&eacute;s with their windows thrown up high and their
vivacious groups at little tables on the pavement, the light and
glitter of the houses turned as it were inside out, soon convince
me that it is no dream; that I am in Paris, howsoever I got
there.&nbsp; I stroll down to the sparkling Palais Royal, up the
Rue de Rivoli, to the Place Vend&ocirc;me.&nbsp; As I glance into
a print-shop window, Monied Interest, my late travelling
companion, comes upon me, laughing with the highest relish of
disdain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a people!&rsquo; he says,
pointing to Napoleon in the window and Napoleon on the
column.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only one idea all over Paris!&nbsp; A
monomania!&rsquo;&nbsp; Humph!&nbsp; I <span
class="GutSmall">THINK</span> I have seen Napoleon&rsquo;s
match?&nbsp; There was a statue, when I came away, at Hyde Park
Corner, and another in the City, and a print or two in the
shops.</p>
<p>I walk up to the Barri&egrave;re de l&rsquo;Etoile,
sufficiently dazed by my flight to have a pleasant doubt of the
reality of everything about me; of the lively crowd, the
overhanging trees, the performing dogs, the hobby-horses, the
beautiful perspectives of shining lamps: the hundred and one
enclosures, where the singing is, in gleaming orchestras of azure
and gold, and where a star-eyed Houri comes round with a box for
voluntary offerings.&nbsp; So, I pass to my hotel, enchanted;
sup, enchanted; go to bed, enchanted; pushing back this morning
(if it really were this morning) into the remoteness of time,
blessing the South-Eastern Company for realising the Arabian
Nights in these prose days, murmuring, as I wing my idle flight
into the land of dreams, &lsquo;No hurry, ladies and gentlemen,
going to Paris in eleven hours.&nbsp; It is so well done, that
there really is no hurry!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>THE
DETECTIVE POLICE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are not by any means devout
believers in the old Bow Street Police.&nbsp; To say the truth,
we think there was a vast amount of humbug about those
worthies.&nbsp; Apart from many of them being men of very
indifferent character, and far too much in the habit of
consorting with thieves and the like, they never lost a public
occasion of jobbing and trading in mystery and making the most of
themselves.&nbsp; Continually puffed besides by incompetent
magistrates anxious to conceal their own deficiencies, and
hand-in-glove with the penny-a-liners of that time, they became a
sort of superstition.&nbsp; Although as a Preventive Police they
were utterly ineffective, and as a Detective Police were very
loose and uncertain in their operations, they remain with some
people a superstition to the present day.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Detective Force organised since the
establishment of the existing Police, is so well chosen and
trained, proceeds so systematically and quietly, does its
business in such a workmanlike manner, and is always so calmly
and steadily engaged in the service of the public, that the
public really do not know enough of it, to know a tithe of its
usefulness.&nbsp; Impressed with this conviction, and interested
in the men themselves, we represented to the authorities at
Scotland Yard, that we should be glad, if there were no official
objection, to have some talk with the Detectives.&nbsp; A most
obliging and ready permission being given, a certain evening was
appointed with a certain Inspector for a social conference
between ourselves and the Detectives, at The Household Words
Office in Wellington Street, Strand, London.&nbsp; In consequence
of which appointment the party &lsquo;came off,&rsquo; which we
are about to describe.&nbsp; And we beg to repeat that, avoiding
such topics as it might for obvious reasons be injurious to the
public, or disagreeable to respectable individuals, to touch upon
in print, our description is as exact as we can make it.</p>
<p>The reader will have the goodness to imagine the Sanctum
Sanctorum of Household Words.&nbsp; Anything that best suits the
reader&rsquo;s fancy, will best represent that magnificent
chamber.&nbsp; We merely stipulate for a round table in the
middle, with some glasses and cigars arranged upon it; and the
editorial sofa elegantly hemmed in between that stately piece of
furniture and the wall.</p>
<p>It is a sultry evening at dusk.&nbsp; The stones of Wellington
Street are hot and gritty, and the watermen and hackney-coachmen
at the Theatre opposite, are much flushed and aggravated.&nbsp;
Carriages are constantly setting down the people who have come to
Fairy-Land; and there is a mighty shouting and bellowing every
now and then, deafening us for the moment, through the open
windows.</p>
<p>Just at dusk, Inspectors Wield and Stalker are announced; but
we do not undertake to warrant the orthography of any of the
names here mentioned.&nbsp; Inspector Wield presents Inspector
Stalker.&nbsp; Inspector Wield is a middle-aged man of a portly
presence, with a large, moist, knowing eye, a husky voice, and a
habit of emphasising his conversation by the aid of a corpulent
fore-finger, which is constantly in juxtaposition with his eyes
or nose.&nbsp; Inspector Stalker is a shrewd, hard-headed
Scotchman&mdash;in appearance not at all unlike a very acute,
thoroughly-trained schoolmaster, from the Normal Establishment at
Glasgow.&nbsp; Inspector Wield one might have known, perhaps, for
what he is&mdash;Inspector Stalker, never.</p>
<p>The ceremonies of reception over, Inspectors Wield and Stalker
observe that they have brought some sergeants with them.&nbsp;
The sergeants are presented&mdash;five in number, Sergeant
Dornton, Sergeant Witchem, Sergeant Mith, Sergeant Fendall, and
Sergeant Straw.&nbsp; We have the whole Detective Force from
Scotland Yard, with one exception.&nbsp; They sit down in a
semi-circle (the two Inspectors at the two ends) at a little
distance from the round table, facing the editorial sofa.&nbsp;
Every man of them, in a glance, immediately takes an inventory of
the furniture and an accurate sketch of the editorial
presence.&nbsp; The Editor feels that any gentleman in company
could take him up, if need should be, without the smallest
hesitation, twenty years hence.</p>
<p>The whole party are in plain clothes.&nbsp; Sergeant Dornton
about fifty years of age, with a ruddy face and a high sunburnt
forehead, has the air of one who has been a Sergeant in the
army&mdash;he might have sat to Wilkie for the Soldier in the
Reading of the Will.&nbsp; He is famous for steadily pursuing the
inductive process, and, from small beginnings, working on from
clue to clue until he bags his man.&nbsp; Sergeant Witchem,
shorter and thicker-set, and marked with the small-pox, has
something of a reserved and thoughtful air, as if he were engaged
in deep arithmetical calculations.&nbsp; He is renowned for his
acquaintance with the swell mob.&nbsp; Sergeant Mith, a
smooth-faced man with a fresh bright complexion, and a strange
air of simplicity, is a dab at housebreakers.&nbsp; Sergeant
Fendall, a light-haired, well-spoken, polite person, is a
prodigious hand at pursuing private inquiries of a delicate
nature.&nbsp; Straw, a little wiry Sergeant of meek demeanour and
strong sense, would knock at a door and ask a series of questions
in any mild character you choose to prescribe to him, from a
charity-boy upwards, and seem as innocent as an infant.&nbsp;
They are, one and all, respectable-looking men; of perfectly good
deportment and unusual intelligence; with nothing lounging or
slinking in their manners; with an air of keen observation and
quick perception when addressed; and generally presenting in
their faces, traces more or less marked of habitually leading
lives of strong mental excitement.&nbsp; They have all good eyes;
and they all can, and they all do, look full at whomsoever they
speak to.</p>
<p>We light the cigars, and hand round the glasses (which are
very temperately used indeed), and the conversation begins by a
modest amateur reference on the Editorial part to the swell
mob.&nbsp; Inspector Wield immediately removes his cigar from his
lips, waves his right hand, and says, &lsquo;Regarding the swell
mob, sir, I can&rsquo;t do better than call upon Sergeant
Witchem.&nbsp; Because the reason why?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you.&nbsp; Sergeant Witchem is better acquainted with the swell
mob than any officer in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our heart leaping up when we beheld this rainbow in the sky,
we turn to Sergeant Witchem, who very concisely, and in
well-chosen language, goes into the subject forthwith.&nbsp;
Meantime, the whole of his brother officers are closely
interested in attending to what he says, and observing its
effect.&nbsp; Presently they begin to strike in, one or two
together, when an opportunity offers, and the conversation
becomes general.&nbsp; But these brother officers only come in to
the assistance of each other&mdash;not to the
contradiction&mdash;and a more amicable brotherhood there could
not be.&nbsp; From the swell mob, we diverge to the kindred
topics of cracksmen, fences, public-house dancers, area-sneaks,
designing young people who go out &lsquo;gonophing,&rsquo; and
other &lsquo;schools.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is observable throughout
these revelations, that Inspector Stalker, the Scotchman, is
always exact and statistical, and that when any question of
figures arises, everybody as by one consent pauses, and looks to
him.</p>
<p>When we have exhausted the various schools of Art&mdash;during
which discussion the whole body have remained profoundly
attentive, except when some unusual noise at the Theatre over the
way has induced some gentleman to glance inquiringly towards the
window in that direction, behind his next neighbour&rsquo;s
back&mdash;we burrow for information on such points as the
following.&nbsp; Whether there really are any highway robberies
in London, or whether some circumstances not convenient to be
mentioned by the aggrieved party, usually precede the robberies
complained of, under that head, which quite change their
character?&nbsp; Certainly the latter, almost always.&nbsp;
Whether in the case of robberies in houses, where servants are
necessarily exposed to doubt, innocence under suspicion ever
becomes so like guilt in appearance, that a good officer need be
cautious how he judges it?&nbsp; Undoubtedly.&nbsp; Nothing is so
common or deceptive as such appearances at first.&nbsp; Whether
in a place of public amusement, a thief knows an officer, and an
officer knows a thief&mdash;supposing them, beforehand, strangers
to each other&mdash;because each recognises in the other, under
all disguise, an inattention to what is going on, and a purpose
that is not the purpose of being entertained?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the way exactly.&nbsp; Whether it is reasonable or
ridiculous to trust to the alleged experiences of thieves as
narrated by themselves, in prisons, or penitentiaries, or
anywhere?&nbsp; In general, nothing more absurd.&nbsp; Lying is
their habit and their trade; and they would rather lie&mdash;even
if they hadn&rsquo;t an interest in it, and didn&rsquo;t want to
make themselves agreeable&mdash;than tell the truth.</p>
<p>From these topics, we glide into a review of the most
celebrated and horrible of the great crimes that have been
committed within the last fifteen or twenty years.&nbsp; The men
engaged in the discovery of almost all of them, and in the
pursuit or apprehension of the murderers, are here, down to the
very last instance.&nbsp; One of our guests gave chase to and
boarded the emigrant ship, in which the murderess last hanged in
London was supposed to have embarked.&nbsp; We learn from him
that his errand was not announced to the passengers, who may have
no idea of it to this hour.&nbsp; That he went below, with the
captain, lamp in hand&mdash;it being dark, and the whole steerage
abed and sea-sick&mdash;and engaged the Mrs. Manning who was on
board, in a conversation about her luggage, until she was, with
no small pains, induced to raise her head, and turn her face
towards the light.&nbsp; Satisfied that she was not the object of
his search, he quietly re-embarked in the Government steamer
along-side, and steamed home again with the intelligence.</p>
<p>When we have exhausted these subjects, too, which occupy a
considerable time in the discussion, two or three leave their
chairs, whisper Sergeant Witchem, and resume their seat.&nbsp;
Sergeant Witchem, leaning forward a little, and placing a hand on
each of his legs, then modestly speaks as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother-officers wish me to relate a little account
of my taking Tally-ho Thompson.&nbsp; A man oughtn&rsquo;t to
tell what he has done himself; but still, as nobody was with me,
and, consequently, as nobody but myself can tell it, I&rsquo;ll
do it in the best way I can, if it should meet your
approval.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We assure Sergeant Witchem that he will oblige us very much,
and we all compose ourselves to listen with great interest and
attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tally-ho Thompson,&rsquo; says Sergeant Witchem, after
merely wetting his lips with his brandy-and-water,
&lsquo;Tally-ho Thompson was a famous horse-stealer, couper, and
magsman.&nbsp; Thompson, in conjunction with a pal that
occasionally worked with him, gammoned a countryman out of a good
round sum of money, under pretence of getting him a
situation&mdash;the regular old dodge&mdash;and was afterwards in
the &ldquo;Hue and Cry&rdquo; for a horse&mdash;a horse that he
stole down in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; I had to look after Thompson,
and I applied myself, of course, in the first instance, to
discovering where he was.&nbsp; Now, Thompson&rsquo;s wife lived,
along with a little daughter, at Chelsea.&nbsp; Knowing that
Thompson was somewhere in the country, I watched the
house&mdash;especially at post-time in the morning&mdash;thinking
Thompson was pretty likely to write to her.&nbsp; Sure enough,
one morning the postman comes up, and delivers a letter at Mrs.
Thompson&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Little girl opens the door, and
takes it in.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not always sure of postmen, though
the people at the post-offices are always very obliging.&nbsp; A
postman may help us, or he may not,&mdash;just as it
happens.&nbsp; However, I go across the road, and I say to the
postman, after he has left the letter, &ldquo;Good morning! how
are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How are <i>you</i>?&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just delivered a letter for Mrs.
Thompson.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t happen to remark what the post-mark was,
perhaps?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be plain with you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in a small
way of business, and I have given Thompson credit, and I
can&rsquo;t afford to lose what he owes me.&nbsp; I know
he&rsquo;s got money, and I know he&rsquo;s in the country, and
if you could tell me what the post-mark was, I should be very
much obliged to you, and you&rsquo;d do a service to a tradesman
in a small way of business that can&rsquo;t afford a
loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do
assure you that I did not observe what the post-mark was; all I
know is, that there was money in the letter&mdash;I should say a
sovereign.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was enough for me, because of course
I knew that Thompson having sent his wife money, it was probable
she&rsquo;d write to Thompson, by return of post, to acknowledge
the receipt.&nbsp; So I said &ldquo;Thankee&rdquo; to the
postman, and I kept on the watch.&nbsp; In the afternoon I saw
the little girl come out.&nbsp; Of course I followed her.&nbsp;
She went into a stationer&rsquo;s shop, and I needn&rsquo;t say
to you that I looked in at the window.&nbsp; She bought some
writing-paper and envelopes, and a pen.&nbsp; I think to myself,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;&mdash;watch her home
again&mdash;and don&rsquo;t go away, you may be sure, knowing
that Mrs. Thompson was writing her letter to Tally-ho, and that
the letter would be posted presently.&nbsp; In about an hour or
so, out came the little girl again, with the letter in her
hand.&nbsp; I went up, and said something to the child, whatever
it might have been; but I couldn&rsquo;t see the direction of the
letter, because she held it with the seal upwards.&nbsp; However,
I observed that on the back of the letter there was what we call
a kiss&mdash;a drop of wax by the side of the seal&mdash;and
again, you understand, that was enough for me.&nbsp; I saw her
post the letter, waited till she was gone, then went into the
shop, and asked to see the Master.&nbsp; When he came out, I told
him, &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m an Officer in the Detective Force;
there&rsquo;s a letter with a kiss been posted here just now, for
a man that I&rsquo;m in search of; and what I have to ask of you,
is, that you will let me look at the direction of that
letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was very civil&mdash;took a lot of
letters from the box in the window&mdash;shook &rsquo;em out on
the counter with the faces downwards&mdash;and there among
&rsquo;em was the identical letter with the kiss.&nbsp; It was
directed, Mr. Thomas Pigeon, Post Office, B&mdash;, to be left
till called for.&nbsp; Down I went to B&mdash; (a hundred and
twenty miles or so) that night.&nbsp; Early next morning I went
to the Post Office; saw the gentleman in charge of that
department; told him who I was; and that my object was to see,
and track, the party that should come for the letter for Mr.
Thomas Pigeon.&nbsp; He was very polite, and said, &ldquo;You
shall have every assistance we can give you; you can wait inside
the office; and we&rsquo;ll take care to let you know when
anybody comes for the letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I waited there
three days, and began to think that nobody ever would come.&nbsp;
At last the clerk whispered to me, &ldquo;Here!&nbsp;
Detective!&nbsp; Somebody&rsquo;s come for the
letter!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep him a minute,&rdquo; said I, and
I ran round to the outside of the office.&nbsp; There I saw a
young chap with the appearance of an Ostler, holding a horse by
the bridle&mdash;stretching the bridle across the pavement, while
he waited at the Post Office Window for the letter.&nbsp; I began
to pat the horse, and that; and I said to the boy, &ldquo;Why,
this is Mr. Jones&rsquo;s Mare!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; It
an&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very like Mr. Jones&rsquo;s Mare!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;She an&rsquo;t Mr. Jones&rsquo;s Mare, anyhow,&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. So and So&rsquo;s, of the Warwick
Arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; And up he jumped, and off he went&mdash;letter
and all.&nbsp; I got a cab, followed on the box, and was so quick
after him that I came into the stable-yard of the Warwick Arms,
by one gate, just as he came in by another.&nbsp; I went into the
bar, where there was a young woman serving, and called for a
glass of brandy-and-water.&nbsp; He came in directly, and handed
her the letter.&nbsp; She casually looked at it, without saying
anything, and stuck it up behind the glass over the
chimney-piece.&nbsp; What was to be done next?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I turned it over in my mind while I drank my
brandy-and-water (looking pretty sharp at the letter the while),
but I couldn&rsquo;t see my way out of it at all.&nbsp; I tried
to get lodgings in the house, but there had been a horse-fair, or
something of that sort, and it was full.&nbsp; I was obliged to
put up somewhere else, but I came backwards and forwards to the
bar for a couple of days, and there was the letter always behind
the glass.&nbsp; At last I thought I&rsquo;d write a letter to
Mr. Pigeon myself, and see what that would do.&nbsp; So I wrote
one, and posted it, but I purposely addressed it, Mr. John
Pigeon, instead of Mr. Thomas Pigeon, to see what that would
do.&nbsp; In the morning (a very wet morning it was) I watched
the postman down the street, and cut into the bar, just before he
reached the Warwick Arms.&nbsp; In he came presently with my
letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there a Mr. John Pigeon staying
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&mdash;stop a bit though,&rdquo;
says the barmaid; and she took down the letter behind the
glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
Thomas, and he is not staying here.&nbsp; Would you do me a
favour, and post this for me, as it is so wet?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
postman said Yes; she folded it in another envelope, directed it,
and gave it him.&nbsp; He put it in his hat, and away he
went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no difficulty in finding out the direction of
that letter.&nbsp; It was addressed Mr. Thomas Pigeon, Post
Office, R&mdash;, Northamptonshire, to be left till called
for.&nbsp; Off I started directly for R&mdash;; I said the same
at the Post Office there, as I had said at B&mdash;; and again I
waited three days before anybody came.&nbsp; At last another chap
on horseback came.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any letters for Mr. Thomas
Pigeon?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;New Inn, near R&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He got the letter,
and away he went at a canter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I made my inquiries about the New Inn, near R&mdash;,
and hearing it was a solitary sort of house, a little in the
horse line, about a couple of miles from the station, I thought
I&rsquo;d go and have a look at it.&nbsp; I found it what it had
been described, and sauntered in, to look about me.&nbsp; The
landlady was in the bar, and I was trying to get into
conversation with her; asked her how business was, and spoke
about the wet weather, and so on; when I saw, through an open
door, three men sitting by the fire in a sort of parlour, or
kitchen; and one of those men, according to the description I had
of him, was Tally-ho Thompson!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went and sat down among &rsquo;em, and tried to make
things agreeable; but they were very shy&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
talk at all&mdash;looked at me, and at one another, in a way
quite the reverse of sociable.&nbsp; I reckoned &rsquo;em up, and
finding that they were all three bigger men than me, and
considering that their looks were ugly&mdash;that it was a lonely
place&mdash;railroad station two miles off&mdash;and night coming
on&mdash;thought I couldn&rsquo;t do better than have a drop of
brandy-and-water to keep my courage up.&nbsp; So I called for my
brandy-and-water; and as I was sitting drinking it by the fire,
Thompson got up and went out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now the difficulty of it was, that I wasn&rsquo;t sure
it was Thompson, because I had never set eyes on him before; and
what I had wanted was to be quite certain of him.&nbsp; However,
there was nothing for it now, but to follow, and put a bold face
upon it.&nbsp; I found him talking, outside in the yard, with the
landlady.&nbsp; It turned out afterwards that he was wanted by a
Northampton officer for something else, and that, knowing that
officer to be pock-marked (as I am myself), he mistook me for
him.&nbsp; As I have observed, I found him talking to the
landlady, outside.&nbsp; I put my hand upon his
shoulder&mdash;this way&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Tally-ho Thompson,
it&rsquo;s no use.&nbsp; I know you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an officer
from London, and I take you into custody for felony!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That be d-d!&rdquo; says Tally-ho Thompson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We went back into the house, and the two friends began
to cut up rough, and their looks didn&rsquo;t please me at all, I
assure you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the man go.&nbsp; What are you going
to do with him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I&rsquo;m going to do with him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to take him
to London to-night, as sure as I&rsquo;m alive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not alone here, whatever you may think.&nbsp; You mind your own
business, and keep yourselves to yourselves.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be
better for you, for I know you both very well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>I</i>&rsquo;d never seen or heard of &rsquo;em in all my life,
but my bouncing cowed &rsquo;em a bit, and they kept off, while
Thompson was making ready to go.&nbsp; I thought to myself,
however, that they might be coming after me on the dark road, to
rescue Thompson; so I said to the landlady, &ldquo;What men have
you got in the house, Missis?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t got no men here,&rdquo; she says, sulkily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have got an ostler, I suppose?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve got an ostler.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me
see him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Presently he came, and a shaggy-headed
young fellow he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now attend to me, young
man,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Detective Officer from
London.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s name is Thompson.&nbsp; I have
taken him into custody for felony.&nbsp; I am going to take him
to the railroad station.&nbsp; I call upon you in the
Queen&rsquo;s name to assist me; and mind you, my friend,
you&rsquo;ll get yourself into more trouble than you know of, if
you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&nbsp; You never saw a person open his
eyes so wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Thompson, come along!&rdquo; says
I.&nbsp; But when I took out the handcuffs, Thompson cries,
&ldquo;No!&nbsp; None of that!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t stand
<i>them</i>!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go along with you quiet, but I
won&rsquo;t bear none of that!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tally-ho
Thompson,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to behave as a
man to you, if you are willing to behave as a man to me.&nbsp;
Give me your word that you&rsquo;ll come peaceably along, and I
don&rsquo;t want to handcuff you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will,&rdquo; says Thompson, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have a glass of
brandy first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if
I&rsquo;ve another,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
two more, Missis,&rdquo; said the friends, &ldquo;and confound
you, Constable, you&rsquo;ll give your man a drop, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was agreeable to that, so we had it all
round, and then my man and I took Tally-ho Thompson safe to the
railroad, and I carried him to London that night.&nbsp; He was
afterwards acquitted, on account of a defect in the evidence; and
I understand he always praises me up to the skies, and says
I&rsquo;m one of the best of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This story coming to a termination amidst general applause,
Inspector Wield, after a little grave smoking, fixes his eye on
his host, and thus delivers himself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a bad plant that of mine, on Fikey, the
man accused of forging the Sou&rsquo;-Western Railway
debentures&mdash;it was only t&rsquo;other day&mdash;because the
reason why?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had information that Fikey and his brother kept a
factory over yonder there,&rsquo;&mdash;indicating any region on
the Surrey side of the river&mdash;&lsquo;where he bought
second-hand carriages; so after I&rsquo;d tried in vain to get
hold of him by other means, I wrote him a letter in an assumed
name, saying that I&rsquo;d got a horse and shay to dispose of,
and would drive down next day that he might view the lot, and
make an offer&mdash;very reasonable it was, I said&mdash;a
reg&rsquo;lar bargain.&nbsp; Straw and me then went off to a
friend of mine that&rsquo;s in the livery and job business, and
hired a turn-out for the day, a precious smart turn-out it
was&mdash;quite a slap-up thing!&nbsp; Down we drove,
accordingly, with a friend (who&rsquo;s not in the Force
himself); and leaving my friend in the shay near a public-house,
to take care of the horse, we went to the factory, which was some
little way off.&nbsp; In the factory, there was a number of
strong fellows at work, and after reckoning &rsquo;em up, it was
clear to me that it wouldn&rsquo;t do to try it on there.&nbsp;
They were too many for us.&nbsp; We must get our man out of
doors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Fikey at home?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, he
ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Expected home soon?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, no, not soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Is his
brother here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his
brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! well, this is an
ill-conwenience, this is.&nbsp; I wrote him a letter yesterday,
saying I&rsquo;d got a little turn-out to dispose of, and
I&rsquo;ve took the trouble to bring the turn-out down a&rsquo;
purpose, and now he ain&rsquo;t in the way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t in the way.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t
make it convenient to call again, could you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, no, I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I want to sell;
that&rsquo;s the fact; and I can&rsquo;t put it off.&nbsp; Could
you find him anywheres?&rdquo;&nbsp; At first he said No, he
couldn&rsquo;t, and then he wasn&rsquo;t sure about it, and then
he&rsquo;d go and try.&nbsp; So at last he went up-stairs, where
there was a sort of loft, and presently down comes my man himself
in his shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;this seems to be
rayther a pressing matter of yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> rayther a pressing
matter, and you&rsquo;ll find it a bargain&mdash;dirt
cheap.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t in partickler want of a
bargain just now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but where is
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;the
turn-out&rsquo;s just outside.&nbsp; Come and look at
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t any suspicions, and away we
go.&nbsp; And the first thing that happens is, that the horse
runs away with my friend (who knows no more of driving than a
child) when he takes a little trot along the road to show his
paces.&nbsp; You never saw such a game in your life!</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the bolt is over, and the turn-out has come to a
standstill again, Fikey walks round and round it as grave as a
judge&mdash;me too.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, sir!&rdquo; I says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a neat thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
ain&rsquo;t a bad style of thing,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe you,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a
horse!&rdquo;&mdash;for I saw him looking at it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rising eight!&rdquo; I says, rubbing his fore-legs.&nbsp;
(Bless you, there ain&rsquo;t a man in the world knows less of
horses than I do, but I&rsquo;d heard my friend at the Livery
Stables say he was eight year old, so I says, as knowing as
possible, &ldquo;Rising eight.&rdquo;)&nbsp; &ldquo;Rising eight,
is he?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rising eight,&rdquo; says
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;what do you want for
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the first and last figure for the
whole concern is five-and-twenty pound!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very cheap!&rdquo; he says, looking at
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
told you it was a bargain!&nbsp; Now, without any higgling and
haggling about it, what I want is to sell, and that&rsquo;s my
price.&nbsp; Further, I&rsquo;ll make it easy to you, and take
half the money down, and you can do a bit of stiff <a
name="citation415"></a><a href="#footnote415"
class="citation">[415]</a> for the balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says again, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very
cheap.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; says I;
&ldquo;get in and try it, and you&rsquo;ll buy it.&nbsp; Come!
take a trial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ecod, he gets in, and we get in, and we drive along the
road, to show him to one of the railway clerks that was hid in
the public-house window to identify him.&nbsp; But the clerk was
bothered, and didn&rsquo;t know whether it was him, or
wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;because the reason why?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you,&mdash;on account of his having shaved his whiskers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clever little horse,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;and trots well; and the shay runs light.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not a doubt about it,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now,
Mr. Fikey, I may as well make it all right, without wasting any
more of your time.&nbsp; The fact is, I&rsquo;m Inspector Wield,
and you&rsquo;re my prisoner.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
mean that?&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do,
indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then burn my body,&rdquo; says Fikey,
&ldquo;if this ain&rsquo;t too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you never saw a man so knocked over with
surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll let me have my
coat?&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s drive to the factory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, not exactly that, I think,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there, once before, to-day.&nbsp; Suppose
we send for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw it was no go, so he sent for
it, and put it on, and we drove him up to London,
comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This reminiscence is in the height of its success, when a
general proposal is made to the fresh-complexioned, smooth-faced
officer, with the strange air of simplicity, to tell the
&lsquo;Butcher&rsquo;s Story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fresh-complexioned, smooth-faced officer, with the strange
air of simplicity, began with a rustic smile, and in a soft,
wheedling tone of voice, to relate the Butcher&rsquo;s Story,
thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just about six years ago, now, since
information was given at Scotland Yard of there being extensive
robberies of lawns and silks going on, at some wholesale houses
in the City.&nbsp; Directions were given for the business being
looked into; and Straw, and Fendall, and me, we were all in
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you received your instructions,&rsquo; said we,
&lsquo;you went away, and held a sort of Cabinet Council
together!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The smooth-faced officer coaxingly replied,
&lsquo;Ye-es.&nbsp; Just so.&nbsp; We turned it over among
ourselves a good deal.&nbsp; It appeared, when we went into it,
that the goods were sold by the receivers extraordinarily
cheap&mdash;much cheaper than they could have been if they had
been honestly come by.&nbsp; The receivers were in the trade, and
kept capital shops&mdash;establishments of the first
respectability&mdash;one of &rsquo;em at the West End, one down
in Westminster.&nbsp; After a lot of watching and inquiry, and
this and that among ourselves, we found that the job was managed,
and the purchases of the stolen goods made, at a little
public-house near Smithfield, down by Saint Bartholomew&rsquo;s;
where the Warehouse Porters, who were the thieves, took &rsquo;em
for that purpose, don&rsquo;t you see? and made appointments to
meet the people that went between themselves and the
receivers.&nbsp; This public-house was principally used by
journeymen butchers from the country, out of place, and in want
of situations; so, what did we do, but&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;we
agreed that I should be dressed up like a butcher myself, and go
and live there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never, surely, was a faculty of observation better brought to
bear upon a purpose, than that which picked out this officer for
the part.&nbsp; Nothing in all creation could have suited him
better.&nbsp; Even while he spoke, he became a greasy, sleepy,
shy, good-natured, chuckle-headed, unsuspicious, and confiding
young butcher.&nbsp; His very hair seemed to have suet in it, as
he made it smooth upon his head, and his fresh complexion to be
lubricated by large quantities of animal food.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;So I&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; (always with the
confiding snigger of the foolish young butcher) &lsquo;so I
dressed myself in the regular way, made up a little bundle of
clothes, and went to the public-house, and asked if I could have
a lodging there?&nbsp; They says, &ldquo;yes, you can have a
lodging here,&rdquo; and I got a bedroom, and settled myself down
in the tap.&nbsp; There was a number of people about the place,
and coming backwards and forwards to the house; and first one
says, and then another says, &ldquo;Are you from the country,
young man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I
am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come out of Northamptonshire, and I&rsquo;m
quite lonely here, for I don&rsquo;t know London at all, and
it&rsquo;s such a mighty big town.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
<i>is</i> a big town,&rdquo; they says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s a <i>very</i> big town!&rdquo; I says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Really and truly I never was in such a town.&nbsp; It
quite confuses of me!&rdquo; and all that, you know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When some of the journeymen Butchers that used the
house, found that I wanted a place, they says, &ldquo;Oh,
we&rsquo;ll get you a place!&rdquo;&nbsp; And they actually took
me to a sight of places, in Newgate Market, Newport Market,
Clare, Carnaby&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where all.&nbsp; But the
wages was&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;was not sufficient, and I never
could suit myself, don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; Some of the queer
frequenters of the house were a little suspicious of me at first,
and I was obliged to be very cautious indeed how I communicated
with Straw or Fendall.&nbsp; Sometimes, when I went out,
pretending to stop and look into the shop windows, and just
casting my eye round, I used to see some of &rsquo;em following
me; but, being perhaps better accustomed than they thought for,
to that sort of thing, I used to lead &rsquo;em on as far as I
thought necessary or convenient&mdash;sometimes a long
way&mdash;and then turn sharp round, and meet &rsquo;em, and say,
&ldquo;Oh, dear, how glad I am to come upon you so
fortunate!&nbsp; This London&rsquo;s such a place, I&rsquo;m
blowed if I ain&rsquo;t lost again!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
we&rsquo;d go back all together, to the public-house,
and&mdash;ha, ha, ha! and smoke our pipes, don&rsquo;t you
see?</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were very attentive to me, I am sure.&nbsp; It was
a common thing, while I was living there, for some of &rsquo;em
to take me out, and show me London.&nbsp; They showed me the
Prisons&mdash;showed me Newgate&mdash;and when they showed me
Newgate, I stops at the place where the Porters pitch their
loads, and says, &ldquo;Oh dear, is this where they hang the
men?&nbsp; Oh Lor!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That!&rdquo; they says,
&ldquo;what a simple cove he is!&nbsp; <i>That</i> ain&rsquo;t
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, they pointed out which was it, and I
says &ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; and they says, &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll
know it agen, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I said I thought
I should if I tried hard&mdash;and I assure you I kept a sharp
look out for the City Police when we were out in this way, for if
any of &rsquo;em had happened to know me, and had spoke to me, it
would have been all up in a minute.&nbsp; However, by good luck
such a thing never happened, and all went on quiet: though the
difficulties I had in communicating with my brother officers were
quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The stolen goods that were brought to the public-house
by the Warehouse Porters, were always disposed of in a back
parlour.&nbsp; For a long time, I never could get into this
parlour, or see what was done there.&nbsp; As I sat smoking my
pipe, like an innocent young chap, by the tap-room fire,
I&rsquo;d hear some of the parties to the robbery, as they came
in and out, say softly to the landlord, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
that?&nbsp; What does he do here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless your
soul,&rdquo; says the landlord, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only
a&rdquo;&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s only a green
young fellow from the country, as is looking for a
butcher&rsquo;s sitiwation.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; So, in course of time, they were so convinced
of my being green, and got to be so accustomed to me, that I was
as free of the parlour as any of &rsquo;em, and I have seen as
much as Seventy Pounds&rsquo; Worth of fine lawn sold there, in
one night, that was stolen from a warehouse in Friday
Street.&nbsp; After the sale the buyers always stood
treat&mdash;hot supper, or dinner, or what not&mdash;and
they&rsquo;d say on those occasions, &ldquo;Come on,
Butcher!&nbsp; Put your best leg foremost, young &lsquo;un, and
walk into it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Which I used to do&mdash;and hear, at
table, all manner of particulars that it was very important for
us Detectives to know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This went on for ten weeks.&nbsp; I lived in the
public-house all the time, and never was out of the
Butcher&rsquo;s dress&mdash;except in bed.&nbsp; At last, when I
had followed seven of the thieves, and set &rsquo;em to
rights&mdash;that&rsquo;s an expression of ours, don&rsquo;t you
see, by which I mean to say that I traced &rsquo;em, and found
out where the robberies were done, and all about
&rsquo;em&mdash;Straw, and Fendall, and I, gave one another the
office, and at a time agreed upon, a descent was made upon the
public-house, and the apprehensions effected.&nbsp; One of the
first things the officers did, was to collar me&mdash;for the
parties to the robbery weren&rsquo;t to suppose yet, that I was
anything but a Butcher&mdash;on which the landlord cries out,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take him,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;whatever you
do!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s only a poor young chap from the country, and
butter wouldn&rsquo;t melt in his mouth!&rdquo;&nbsp; However,
they&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;they took me, and pretended to
search my bedroom, where nothing was found but an old fiddle
belonging to the landlord, that had got there somehow or
another.&nbsp; But, it entirely changed the landlord&rsquo;s
opinion, for when it was produced, he says, &ldquo;My
fiddle!&nbsp; The Butcher&rsquo;s a purloiner!&nbsp; I give him
into custody for the robbery of a musical instrument!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man that had stolen the goods in Friday Street was
not taken yet.&nbsp; He had told me, in confidence, that he had
his suspicions there was something wrong (on account of the City
Police having captured one of the party), and that he was going
to make himself scarce.&nbsp; I asked him, &ldquo;Where do you
mean to go, Mr. Shepherdson?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
Butcher,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the Setting Moon, in the
Commercial Road, is a snug house, and I shall bang out there for
a time.&nbsp; I shall call myself Simpson, which appears to me to
be a modest sort of a name.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;ll give us a
look in, Butcher?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;I think I will give you a call&rdquo;&mdash;which I fully
intended, don&rsquo;t you see, because, of course, he was to be
taken!&nbsp; I went over to the Setting Moon next day, with a
brother officer, and asked at the bar for Simpson.&nbsp; They
pointed out his room, up-stairs.&nbsp; As we were going up, he
looks down over the banister, and calls out, &ldquo;Halloa,
Butcher! is that you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
me.&nbsp; How do you find yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bobbish,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but who&rsquo;s that with
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a young man,
that&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
along, then,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;any friend of the
Butcher&rsquo;s is as welcome as the Butcher!&rdquo;&nbsp; So, I
made my friend acquainted with him, and we took him into
custody.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no idea, sir, what a sight it was, in Court,
when they first knew that I wasn&rsquo;t a Butcher, after
all!&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t produced at the first examination, when
there was a remand; but I was at the second.&nbsp; And when I
stepped into the box, in full police uniform, and the whole party
saw how they had been done, actually a groan of horror and dismay
proceeded from &rsquo;em in the dock!</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the Old Bailey, when their trials came on, Mr.
Clarkson was engaged for the defence, and he couldn&rsquo;t make
out how it was, about the Butcher.&nbsp; He thought, all along,
it was a real Butcher.&nbsp; When the counsel for the prosecution
said, &ldquo;I will now call before you, gentlemen, the
Police-officer,&rdquo; meaning myself, Mr. Clarkson says,
&ldquo;Why Police-officer?&nbsp; Why more Police-officers?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t want Police.&nbsp; We have had a great deal too
much of the Police.&nbsp; I want the Butcher!&rdquo;&nbsp;
However, sir, he had the Butcher and the Police-officer, both in
one.&nbsp; Out of seven prisoners committed for trial, five were
found guilty, and some of &rsquo;em were transported.&nbsp; The
respectable firm at the West End got a term of imprisonment; and
that&rsquo;s the Butcher&rsquo;s Story!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story done, the chuckle-headed Butcher again resolved
himself into the smooth-faced Detective.&nbsp; But, he was so
extremely tickled by their having taken him about, when he was
that Dragon in disguise, to show him London, that he could not
help reverting to that point in his narrative; and gently
repeating with the Butcher snigger, &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh,
dear,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;is that where they hang the
men?&nbsp; Oh, Lor!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>That</i>!&rdquo; says
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a simple cove he is!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It being now late, and the party very modest in their fear of
being too diffuse, there were some tokens of separation; when
Sergeant Dornton, the soldierly-looking man, said, looking round
him with a smile:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before we break up, sir, perhaps you might have some
amusement in hearing of the Adventures of a Carpet Bag.&nbsp;
They are very short; and, I think, curious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We welcomed the Carpet Bag, as cordially as Mr. Shepherdson
welcomed the false Butcher at the Setting Moon.&nbsp; Sergeant
Dornton proceeded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In 1847, I was despatched to Chatham, in search of one
Mesheck, a Jew.&nbsp; He had been carrying on, pretty heavily, in
the bill-stealing way, getting acceptances from young men of good
connexions (in the army chiefly), on pretence of discount, and
bolting with the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mesheck was off, before I got to Chatham.&nbsp; All I
could learn about him was, that he had gone, probably to London,
and had with him&mdash;a Carpet Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came back to town, by the last train from Blackwall,
and made inquiries concerning a Jew passenger with&mdash;a Carpet
Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The office was shut up, it being the last train.&nbsp;
There were only two or three porters left.&nbsp; Looking after a
Jew with a Carpet Bag, on the Blackwall Railway, which was then
the high road to a great Military Dep&ocirc;t, was worse than
looking after a needle in a hayrick.&nbsp; But it happened that
one of these porters had carried, for a certain Jew, to a certain
public-house, a certain&mdash;Carpet Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to the public-house, but the Jew had only left
his luggage there for a few hours, and had called for it in a
cab, and taken it away.&nbsp; I put such questions there, and to
the porter, as I thought prudent, and got at this description
of&mdash;the Carpet Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a bag which had, on one side of it, worked in
worsted, a green parrot on a stand.&nbsp; A green parrot on a
stand was the means by which to identify that&mdash;Carpet
Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I traced Mesheck, by means of this green parrot on a
stand, to Cheltenham, to Birmingham, to Liverpool, to the
Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; At Liverpool he was too many for me.&nbsp;
He had gone to the United States, and I gave up all thoughts of
Mesheck, and likewise of his&mdash;Carpet Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many months afterwards&mdash;near a year
afterwards&mdash;there was a bank in Ireland robbed of seven
thousand pounds, by a person of the name of Doctor Dundey, who
escaped to America; from which country some of the stolen notes
came home.&nbsp; He was supposed to have bought a farm in New
Jersey.&nbsp; Under proper management, that estate could be
seized and sold, for the benefit of the parties he had
defrauded.&nbsp; I was sent off to America for this purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I landed at Boston.&nbsp; I went on to New York.&nbsp;
I found that he had lately changed New York paper-money for New
Jersey paper money, and had banked cash in New Brunswick.&nbsp;
To take this Doctor Dundey, it was necessary to entrap him into
the State of New York, which required a deal of artifice and
trouble.&nbsp; At one time, he couldn&rsquo;t be drawn into an
appointment.&nbsp; At another time, he appointed to come to meet
me, and a New York officer, on a pretext I made; and then his
children had the measles.&nbsp; At last he came, per steamboat,
and I took him, and lodged him in a New York prison called the
Tombs; which I dare say you know, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Editorial acknowledgment to that effect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to the Tombs, on the morning after his capture,
to attend the examination before the magistrate.&nbsp; I was
passing through the magistrate&rsquo;s private room, when,
happening to look round me to take notice of the place, as we
generally have a habit of doing, I clapped my eyes, in one
corner, on a&mdash;Carpet Bag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did I see upon that Carpet Bag, if you&rsquo;ll
believe me, but a green parrot on a stand, as large as life!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That Carpet Bag, with the representation of a
green parrot on a stand,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;belongs to an
English Jew, named Aaron Mesheck, and to no other man, alive or
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give you my word the New York Police Officers were
doubled up with surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How did you ever come to know that?&rdquo; said
they.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think I ought to know that green parrot by
this time,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;for I have had as pretty a dance
after that bird, at home, as ever I had, in all my
life!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;And was it Mesheck&rsquo;s?&rsquo; we submissively
inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it, sir?&nbsp; Of course it was!&nbsp; He was in
custody for another offence, in that very identical Tombs, at
that very identical time.&nbsp; And, more than that!&nbsp; Some
memoranda, relating to the fraud for which I had vainly
endeavoured to take him, were found to be, at that moment, lying
in that very same individual&mdash;Carpet Bag!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Such are the curious coincidences and such is the peculiar
ability, always sharpening and being improved by practice, and
always adapting itself to every variety of circumstances, and
opposing itself to every new device that perverted ingenuity can
invent, for which this important social branch of the public
service is remarkable!&nbsp; For ever on the watch, with their
wits stretched to the utmost, these officers have, from day to
day and year to year, to set themselves against every novelty of
trickery and dexterity that the combined imaginations of all the
lawless rascals in England can devise, and to keep pace with
every such invention that comes out.&nbsp; In the Courts of
Justice, the materials of thousands of such stories as we have
narrated&mdash;often elevated into the marvellous and romantic,
by the circumstances of the case&mdash;are dryly compressed into
the set phrase, &lsquo;in consequence of information I received,
I did so and so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Suspicion was to be directed, by
careful inference and deduction, upon the right person; the right
person was to be taken, wherever he had gone, or whatever he was
doing to avoid detection: he is taken; there he is at the bar;
that is enough.&nbsp; From information I, the officer, received,
I did it; and, according to the custom in these cases, I say no
more.</p>
<p>These games of chess, played with live pieces, are played
before small audiences, and are chronicled nowhere.&nbsp; The
interest of the game supports the player.&nbsp; Its results are
enough for justice.&nbsp; To compare great things with small,
suppose <span class="smcap">Leverrier</span> or <span
class="smcap">Adams</span> informing the public that from
information he had received he had discovered a new planet; or
<span class="smcap">Columbus</span> informing the public of his
day that from information he had received he had discovered a new
continent; so the Detectives inform it that they have discovered
a new fraud or an old offender, and the process is unknown.</p>
<p>Thus, at midnight, closed the proceedings of our curious and
interesting party.&nbsp; But one other circumstance finally wound
up the evening, after our Detective guests had left us.&nbsp; One
of the sharpest among them, and the officer best acquainted with
the Swell Mob, had his pocket picked, going home!</p>

422</span>THREE &lsquo;DETECTIVE&rsquo; ANECDOTES</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;THE PAIR OF GLOVES</h3>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">It&rsquo;s</span> a singler story,
sir,&rsquo; said Inspector Wield, of the Detective Police, who,
in company with Sergeants Dornton and Mith, paid us another
twilight visit, one July evening; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve been
thinking you might like to know it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s concerning the murder of the young woman,
Eliza Grimwood, some years ago, over in the Waterloo Road.&nbsp;
She was commonly called The Countess, because of her handsome
appearance and her proud way of carrying of herself; and when I
saw the poor Countess (I had known her well to speak to), lying
dead, with her throat cut, on the floor of her bedroom,
you&rsquo;ll believe me that a variety of reflections calculated
to make a man rather low in his spirits, came into my head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there.&nbsp; I went to
the house the morning after the murder, and examined the body,
and made a general observation of the bedroom where it was.&nbsp;
Turning down the pillow of the bed with my hand, I found,
underneath it, a pair of gloves.&nbsp; A pair of
gentleman&rsquo;s dress gloves, very dirty; and inside the
lining, the letters <span class="smcap">Tr</span>, and a
cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I took them gloves away, and I showed
&rsquo;em to the magistrate, over at Union Hall, before whom the
case was.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;Wield,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no doubt this is a discovery that may lead
to something very important; and what you have got to do, Wield,
is, to find out the owner of these gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was of the same opinion, of course, and I went at it
immediately.&nbsp; I looked at the gloves pretty narrowly, and it
was my opinion that they had been cleaned.&nbsp; There was a
smell of sulphur and rosin about &rsquo;em, you know, which
cleaned gloves usually have, more or less.&nbsp; I took &rsquo;em
over to a friend of mine at Kennington, who was in that line, and
I put it to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you say now?&nbsp; Have
these gloves been cleaned?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;These gloves have
been cleaned,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you any idea who
cleaned them?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; says
he; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a very distinct idea who didn&rsquo;t clean
&rsquo;em, and that&rsquo;s myself.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you
what, Wield, there ain&rsquo;t above eight or nine reg&rsquo;lar
glove-cleaners in London,&rdquo;&mdash;there were not, at that
time, it seems&mdash;&ldquo;and I think I can give you their
addresses, and you may find out, by that means, who did clean
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, he gave me the directions,
and I went here, and I went there, and I looked up this man, and
I looked up that man; but, though they all agreed that the gloves
had been cleaned, I couldn&rsquo;t find the man, woman, or child,
that had cleaned that aforesaid pair of gloves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What with this person not being at home, and that
person being expected home in the afternoon, and so forth, the
inquiry took me three days.&nbsp; On the evening of the third
day, coming over Waterloo Bridge from the Surrey side of the
river, quite beat, and very much vexed and disappointed, I
thought I&rsquo;d have a shilling&rsquo;s worth of entertainment
at the Lyceum Theatre to freshen myself up.&nbsp; So I went into
the Pit, at half-price, and I sat myself down next to a very
quiet, modest sort of young man.&nbsp; Seeing I was a stranger
(which I thought it just as well to appear to be) he told me the
names of the actors on the stage, and we got into
conversation.&nbsp; When the play was over, we came out together,
and I said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been very companionable and
agreeable, and perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t object to a
drain?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re very good,&rdquo;
says he; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t object to a drain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly, we went to a public-house, near the Theatre, sat
ourselves down in a quiet room up-stairs on the first floor, and
called for a pint of half-and-half, apiece, and a pipe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, we put our pipes aboard, and we drank our
half-and-half, and sat a-talking, very sociably, when the young
man says, &ldquo;You must excuse me stopping very long,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m forced to go home in good
time.&nbsp; I must be at work all night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At
work all night?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a
baker?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, laughing, &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t a baker.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo;
says I, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t the looks of a
baker.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
glove-cleaner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never was more astonished in my life, than when I
heard them words come out of his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a glove-cleaner, are you?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, perhaps,&rdquo;
says I, taking the gloves out of my pocket, &ldquo;you can tell
me who cleaned this pair of gloves?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rum
story,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was dining over at Lambeth,
the other day, at a free-and-easy&mdash;quite
promiscuous&mdash;with a public company&mdash;when some
gentleman, he left these gloves behind him!&nbsp; Another
gentleman and me, you see, we laid a wager of a sovereign, that I
wouldn&rsquo;t find out who they belonged to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
spent as much as seven shillings already, in trying to discover;
but, if you could help me, I&rsquo;d stand another seven and
welcome.&nbsp; You see there&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">Tr</span> and a cross, inside.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>I</i> see,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless you,
<i>I</i> know these gloves very well!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen
dozens of pairs belonging to the same party.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you know who cleaned &rsquo;em?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rather so,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father cleaned
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Where does your father live?&rdquo; says
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just round the corner,&rdquo; says the young man,
&ldquo;near Exeter Street, here.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll tell you who
they belong to, directly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you come
round with me now?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t tell my father that you
found me at the play, you know, because he mightn&rsquo;t like
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;&nbsp; We went round to
the place, and there we found an old man in a white apron, with
two or three daughters, all rubbing and cleaning away at lots of
gloves, in a front parlour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Father!&rdquo; says
the young man, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a person been and made a bet
about the ownership of a pair of gloves, and I&rsquo;ve told him
you can settle it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo;
says I to the old gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the gloves
your son speaks of.&nbsp; Letters <span class="smcap">Tr</span>,
you see, and a cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I know these gloves very well; I&rsquo;ve cleaned dozens
of pairs of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; They belong to Mr. Trinkle, the
great upholsterer in Cheapside.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you get
&rsquo;em from Mr. Trinkle, direct,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ll excuse my asking the question?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;Mr. Trinkle always sends
&rsquo;em to Mr. Phibbs&rsquo;s, the haberdasher&rsquo;s,
opposite his shop, and the haberdasher sends &rsquo;em to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t object to a
drain?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; So I took the old gentleman out, and had a little more
talk with him and his son, over a glass, and we parted excellent
friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This was late on a Saturday night.&nbsp; First thing on
the Monday morning, I went to the haberdasher&rsquo;s shop,
opposite Mr. Trinkle&rsquo;s, the great upholsterer&rsquo;s in
Cheapside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Phibbs in the way?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My name is Phibbs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I believe
you sent this pair of gloves to be cleaned?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I did, for young Mr. Trinkle over the way.&nbsp;
There he is in the shop!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s him
in the shop, is it?&nbsp; Him in the green coat?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The same individual.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Mr. Phibbs,
this is an unpleasant affair; but the fact is, I am Inspector
Wield of the Detective Police, and I found these gloves under the
pillow of the young woman that was murdered the other day, over
in the Waterloo Road!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo;
says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a most respectable young man,
and if his father was to hear of it, it would be the ruin of
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for it,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;but I must take him into custody.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; says Mr. Phibbs, again; &ldquo;can
nothing be done?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; says
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you allow me to call him over here,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;that his father may not see it done?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t object to that,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;but
unfortunately, Mr. Phibbs, I can&rsquo;t allow of any
communication between you.&nbsp; If any was attempted, I should
have to interfere directly.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;ll beckon him
over here?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Phibbs went to the door and beckoned,
and the young fellow came across the street directly; a smart,
brisk young fellow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you
allow me to inquire, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if you ever had
any acquaintance with a party of the name of
Grimwood?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Grimwood!&nbsp; Grimwood!&rdquo;
says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You know the
Waterloo Road?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! of course I know the
Waterloo Road!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Happen to have heard of a
young woman being murdered there?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I read
it in the paper, and very sorry I was to read it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pair of gloves belonging to you, that I
found under her pillow the morning afterwards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was in a dreadful state, sir; a dreadful state I
&ldquo;Mr. Wield,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;upon my solemn oath I
never was there.&nbsp; I never so much as saw her, to my
knowledge, in my life!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very
sorry,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;To tell you the truth; I
don&rsquo;t think you are the murderer, but I must take you to
Union Hall in a cab.&nbsp; However, I think it&rsquo;s a case of
that sort, that, at present, at all events, the magistrate will
hear it in private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A private examination took place, and then it came out
that this young man was acquainted with a cousin of the
unfortunate Eliza Grimwood, and that, calling to see this cousin
a day or two before the murder, he left these gloves upon the
table.&nbsp; Who should come in, shortly afterwards, but Eliza
Grimwood!&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose gloves are these?&rdquo; she says,
taking &rsquo;em up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those are Mr. Trinkle&rsquo;s
gloves,&rdquo; says her cousin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;they are very dirty, and of no use to him, I am
sure.&nbsp; I shall take &rsquo;em away for my girl to clean the
stoves with.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she put &rsquo;em in her
pocket.&nbsp; The girl had used &rsquo;em to clean the stoves,
and, I have no doubt, had left &rsquo;em lying on the bedroom
mantelpiece, or on the drawers, or somewhere; and her mistress,
looking round to see that the room was tidy, had caught &rsquo;em
up and put &rsquo;em under the pillow where I found
&rsquo;em.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the story, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;THE ARTFUL TOUCH</h3>
<p>&lsquo;One of the most beautiful things that ever was done,
perhaps,&rsquo; said Inspector Wield, emphasising the adjective,
as preparing us to expect dexterity or ingenuity rather than
strong interest, &lsquo;was a move of Sergeant
Witchem&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was a lovely idea!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Witchem and me were down at Epsom one Derby Day,
waiting at the station for the Swell Mob.&nbsp; As I mentioned,
when we were talking about these things before, we are ready at
the station when there&rsquo;s races, or an Agricultural Show, or
a Chancellor sworn in for an university, or Jenny Lind, or
anything of that sort; and as the Swell Mob come down, we send
&rsquo;em back again by the next train.&nbsp; But some of the
Swell Mob, on the occasion of this Derby that I refer to, so far
kidded us as to hire a horse and shay; start away from London by
Whitechapel, and miles round; come into Epsom from the opposite
direction; and go to work, right and left, on the course, while
we were waiting for &rsquo;em at the Rail.&nbsp; That, however,
ain&rsquo;t the point of what I&rsquo;m going to tell you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While Witchem and me were waiting at the station, there
comes up one Mr. Tatt; a gentleman formerly in the public line,
quite an amateur Detective in his way, and very much
respected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloa, Charley Wield,&rdquo; he
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you doing here?&nbsp; On the look out
for some of your old friends?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, the old
move, Mr. Tatt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;you and Witchem, and have a glass of sherry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stir from the place,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;till the next train comes in; but after that, we will with
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Tatt waits, and the train comes in,
and then Witchem and me go off with him to the Hotel.&nbsp; Mr.
Tatt he&rsquo;s got up quite regardless of expense, for the
occasion; and in his shirt-front there&rsquo;s a beautiful
diamond prop, cost him fifteen or twenty pound&mdash;a very
handsome pin indeed.&nbsp; We drink our sherry at the bar, and
have had our three or four glasses, when Witchem cries suddenly,
&ldquo;Look out, Mr. Wield! stand fast!&rdquo; and a dash is made
into the place by the Swell Mob&mdash;four of
&rsquo;em&mdash;that have come down as I tell you, and in a
moment Mr. Tatt&rsquo;s prop is gone!&nbsp; Witchem, he cuts
&rsquo;em off at the door, I lay about me as hard as I can, Mr.
Tatt shows fight like a good &lsquo;un, and there we are, all
down together, heads and heels, knocking about on the floor of
the bar&mdash;perhaps you never see such a scene of
confusion!&nbsp; However, we stick to our men (Mr. Tatt being as
good as any officer), and we take &rsquo;em all, and carry
&rsquo;em off to the station.&rsquo;&nbsp; The station&rsquo;s
full of people, who have been took on the course; and it&rsquo;s
a precious piece of work to get &rsquo;em secured.&nbsp; However,
we do it at last, and we search &rsquo;em; but nothing&rsquo;s
found upon &rsquo;em, and they&rsquo;re locked up; and a pretty
state of heat we are in by that time, I assure you!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was very blank over it, myself, to think that the
prop had been passed away; and I said to Witchem, when we had set
&rsquo;em to rights, and were cooling ourselves along with Mr.
Tatt, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t take much by <i>this</i> move,
anyway, for nothing&rsquo;s found upon &rsquo;em, and it&rsquo;s
only the braggadocia, <a name="citation426"></a><a
href="#footnote426" class="citation">[426]</a> after
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr. Wield?&rdquo; says
Witchem.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the diamond pin!&rdquo; and in
the palm of his hand there it was, safe and sound!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, in the name of wonder,&rdquo; says me and Mr. Tatt,
in astonishment, &ldquo;how did you come by that?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how I come by it,&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw which of &rsquo;em took it; and when we
were all down on the floor together, knocking about, I just gave
him a little touch on the back of his hand, as I knew his pal
would; and he thought it <span class="GutSmall">WAS</span> his
pal; and gave it me!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was beautiful,
beau-ti-ful!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even that was hardly the best of the case, for that
chap was tried at the Quarter Sessions at Guildford.&nbsp; You
know what Quarter Sessions are, sir.&nbsp; Well, if you&rsquo;ll
believe me, while them slow justices were looking over the Acts
of Parliament, to see what they could do to him, I&rsquo;m blowed
if he didn&rsquo;t cut out of the dock before their faces!&nbsp;
He cut out of the dock, sir, then and there; swam across a river;
and got up into a tree to dry himself.&nbsp; In the tree he was
took&mdash;an old woman having seen him climb up&mdash;and
Witchem&rsquo;s artful touch transported him!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;THE SOFA</h3>
<p>&lsquo;What young men will do, sometimes, to ruin themselves
and break their friends&rsquo; hearts,&rsquo; said Sergeant
Dornton, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s surprising!&nbsp; I had a case at
Saint Blank&rsquo;s Hospital which was of this sort.&nbsp; A bad
case, indeed, with a bad end!</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Secretary, and the House-Surgeon, and the
Treasurer, of Saint Blank&rsquo;s Hospital, came to Scotland Yard
to give information of numerous robberies having been committed
on the students.&nbsp; The students could leave nothing in the
pockets of their great-coats, while the great-coats were hanging
at the hospital, but it was almost certain to be stolen.&nbsp;
Property of various descriptions was constantly being lost; and
the gentlemen were naturally uneasy about it, and anxious, for
the credit of the institution, that the thief or thieves should
be discovered.&nbsp; The case was entrusted to me, and I went to
the hospital.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, after we had
talked it over; &ldquo;I understand this property is usually lost
from one room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they said.&nbsp; It was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I should wish, if you please,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;to see the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a good-sized bare room down-stairs, with a few
tables and forms in it, and a row of pegs, all round, for hats
and coats.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Next, gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you
suspect anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they said.&nbsp; They did suspect somebody.&nbsp;
They were sorry to say, they suspected one of the porters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to have
that man pointed out to me, and to have a little time to look
after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was pointed out, and I looked after him, and then I
went back to the hospital, and said, &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,
it&rsquo;s not the porter.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s, unfortunately for
himself, a little too fond of drink, but he&rsquo;s nothing
worse.&nbsp; My suspicion is, that these robberies are committed
by one of the students; and if you&rsquo;ll put me a sofa into
that room where the pegs are&mdash;as there&rsquo;s no
closet&mdash;I think I shall be able to detect the thief.&nbsp; I
wish the sofa, if you please, to be covered with chintz, or
something of that sort, so that I may lie on my chest, underneath
it, without being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sofa was provided, and next day at eleven
o&rsquo;clock, before any of the students came, I went there,
with those gentlemen, to get underneath it.&nbsp; It turned out
to be one of those old-fashioned sofas with a great cross-beam at
the bottom, that would have broken my back in no time if I could
ever have got below it.&nbsp; We had quite a job to break all
this away in the time; however, I fell to work, and they fell to
work, and we broke it out, and made a clear place for me.&nbsp; I
got under the sofa, lay down on my chest, took out my knife, and
made a convenient hole in the chintz to look through.&nbsp; It
was then settled between me and the gentlemen that when the
students were all up in the wards, one of the gentlemen should
come in, and hang up a great-coat on one of the pegs.&nbsp; And
that that great-coat should have, in one of the pockets, a
pocket-book containing marked money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After I had been there some time, the students began to
drop into the room, by ones, and twos, and threes, and to talk
about all sorts of things, little thinking there was anybody
under the sofa&mdash;and then to go up-stairs.&nbsp; At last
there came in one who remained until he was alone in the room by
himself.&nbsp; A tallish, good-looking young man of one or two
and twenty, with a light whisker.&nbsp; He went to a particular
hat-peg, took off a good hat that was hanging there, tried it on,
hung his own hat in its place, and hung that hat on another peg,
nearly opposite to me.&nbsp; I then felt quite certain that he
was the thief, and would come back by-and-by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When they were all up-stairs, the gentleman came in
with the great-coat.&nbsp; I showed him where to hang it, so that
I might have a good view of it; and he went away; and I lay under
the sofa on my chest, for a couple of hours or so, waiting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At last, the same young man came down.&nbsp; He walked
across the room, whistling&mdash;stopped and listened&mdash;took
another walk and whistled&mdash;stopped again, and
listened&mdash;then began to go regularly round the pegs, feeling
in the pockets of all the coats.&nbsp; When he came to the
great-coat, and felt the pocket-book, he was so eager and so
hurried that he broke the strap in tearing it open.&nbsp; As he
began to put the money in his pocket, I crawled out from under
the sofa, and his eyes met mine.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;My face, as you may perceive, is brown now, but it was
pale at that time, my health not being good; and looked as long
as a horse&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Besides which, there was a great
draught of air from the door, underneath the sofa, and I had tied
a handkerchief round my head; so what I looked like, altogether,
I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He turned blue&mdash;literally
blue&mdash;when he saw me crawling out, and I couldn&rsquo;t feel
surprised at it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am an officer of the Detective Police,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and have been lying here, since you first came in
this morning.&nbsp; I regret, for the sake of yourself and your
friends, that you should have done what you have; but this case
is complete.&nbsp; You have the pocket-book in your hand and the
money upon you; and I must take you into custody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was impossible to make out any case in his behalf,
and on his trial he pleaded guilty.&nbsp; How or when he got the
means I don&rsquo;t know; but while he was awaiting his sentence,
he poisoned himself in Newgate.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We inquired of this officer, on the conclusion of the
foregoing anecdote, whether the time appeared long, or short,
when he lay in that constrained position under the sofa?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you see, sir,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;if he
hadn&rsquo;t come in, the first time, and I had not been quite
sure he was the thief, and would return, the time would have
seemed long.&nbsp; But, as it was, I being dead certain of my
man, the time seemed pretty short.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 430</span>ON
DUTY WITH INSPECTOR FIELD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> goes the night?&nbsp; Saint
Giles&rsquo;s clock is striking nine.&nbsp; The weather is dull
and wet, and the long lines of street lamps are blurred, as if we
saw them through tears.&nbsp; A damp wind blows and rakes the
pieman&rsquo;s fire out, when he opens the door of his little
furnace, carrying away an eddy of sparks.</p>
<p>Saint Giles&rsquo;s clock strikes nine.&nbsp; We are
punctual.&nbsp; Where is Inspector Field?&nbsp; Assistant
Commissioner of Police is already here, enwrapped in oil-skin
cloak, and standing in the shadow of Saint Giles&rsquo;s
steeple.&nbsp; Detective Sergeant, weary of speaking French all
day to foreigners unpacking at the Great Exhibition, is already
here.&nbsp; Where is Inspector Field?</p>
<p>Inspector Field is, to-night, the guardian genius of the
British Museum.&nbsp; He is bringing his shrewd eye to bear on
every corner of its solitary galleries, before he reports
&lsquo;all right.&rsquo;&nbsp; Suspicious of the Elgin marbles,
and not to be done by cat-faced Egyptian giants with their hands
upon their knees, Inspector Field, sagacious, vigilant, lamp in
hand, throwing monstrous shadows on the walls and ceilings,
passes through the spacious rooms.&nbsp; If a mummy trembled in
an atom of its dusty covering, Inspector Field would say,
&lsquo;Come out of that, Tom Green.&nbsp; I know
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; If the smallest &lsquo;Gonoph&rsquo; about town
were crouching at the bottom of a classic bath, Inspector Field
would nose him with a finer scent than the ogre&rsquo;s, when
adventurous Jack lay trembling in his kitchen copper.&nbsp; But
all is quiet, and Inspector Field goes warily on, making little
outward show of attending to anything in particular, just
recognising the Ichthyosaurus as a familiar acquaintance, and
wondering, perhaps, how the detectives did it in the days before
the Flood.</p>
<p>Will Inspector Field be long about this work?&nbsp; He may be
half-an-hour longer.&nbsp; He sends his compliments by Police
Constable, and proposes that we meet at St. Giles&rsquo;s Station
House, across the road.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; It were as well to
stand by the fire, there, as in the shadow of Saint Giles&rsquo;s
steeple.</p>
<p>Anything doing here to-night?&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; We are
very quiet.&nbsp; A lost boy, extremely calm and small, sitting
by the fire, whom we now confide to a constable to take home, for
the child says that if you show him Newgate Street, he can show
you where he lives&mdash;a raving drunken woman in the cells, who
has screeched her voice away, and has hardly power enough left to
declare, even with the passionate help of her feet and arms, that
she is the daughter of a British officer, and, strike her blind
and dead, but she&rsquo;ll write a letter to the Queen! but who
is soothed with a drink of water&mdash;in another cell, a quiet
woman with a child at her breast, for begging&mdash;in another,
her husband in a smock-frock, with a basket of
watercresses&mdash;in another, a pickpocket&mdash;in another, a
meek tremulous old pauper man who has been out for a holiday
&lsquo;and has took but a little drop, but it has overcome him
after so many months in the house&rsquo;&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
all as yet.&nbsp; Presently, a sensation at the Station House
door.&nbsp; Mr. Field, gentlemen!</p>
<p>Inspector Field comes in, wiping his forehead, for he is of a
burly figure, and has come fast from the ores and metals of the
deep mines of the earth, and from the Parrot Gods of the South
Sea Islands, and from the birds and beetles of the tropics, and
from the Arts of Greece and Rome, and from the Sculptures of
Nineveh, and from the traces of an elder world, when these were
not.&nbsp; Is Rogers ready?&nbsp; Rogers is ready, strapped and
great-coated, with a flaming eye in the middle of his waist, like
a deformed Cyclops.&nbsp; Lead on, Rogers, to Rats&rsquo;
Castle!</p>
<p>How many people may there be in London, who, if we had brought
them deviously and blindfold, to this street, fifty paces from
the Station House, and within call of Saint Giles&rsquo;s church,
would know it for a not remote part of the city in which their
lives are passed?&nbsp; How many, who amidst this compound of
sickening smells, these heaps of filth, these tumbling houses,
with all their vile contents, animate, and inanimate, slimily
overflowing into the black road, would believe that they breathe
<i>this</i> air?&nbsp; How much Red Tape may there be, that could
look round on the faces which now hem us in&mdash;for our
appearance here has caused a rush from all points to a common
centre&mdash;the lowering foreheads, the sallow cheeks, the
brutal eyes, the matted hair, the infected, vermin-haunted heaps
of rags&mdash;and say, &lsquo;I have thought of this.&nbsp; I
have not dismissed the thing.&nbsp; I have neither blustered it
away, nor frozen it away, nor tied it up and put it away, nor
smoothly said pooh, pooh! to it when it has been shown to
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is not what Rogers wants to know, however.&nbsp; What
Rogers wants to know, is, whether you <i>will</i> clear the way
here, some of you, or whether you won&rsquo;t; because if you
don&rsquo;t do it right on end, he&rsquo;ll lock you up!&nbsp;
&lsquo;What!&nbsp; <i>You</i> are there, are you, Bob
Miles?&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t had enough of it yet,
haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You want three months more, do
you?&nbsp; Come away from that gentleman!&nbsp; What are you
creeping round there for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I a doing, thinn, Mr. Rogers?&rsquo; says Bob
Miles, appearing, villainous, at the end of a lane of light, made
by the lantern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know pretty quick, if you
don&rsquo;t hook it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Will</span> you
hook it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sycophantic murmur rises from the crowd.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hook
it, Bob, when Mr. Rogers and Mr. Field tells you!&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you hook it, when you are told to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The most importunate of the voices strikes familiarly on Mr.
Rogers&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; He suddenly turns his lantern on the
owner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; <i>You</i> are there, are you, Mister
Click?&nbsp; You hook it too&mdash;come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What for?&rsquo; says Mr. Click, discomfited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hook it, will you!&rsquo; says Mr. Rogers with
stern emphasis.</p>
<p>Both Click and Miles <i>do</i> &lsquo;hook it,&rsquo; without
another word, or, in plainer English, sneak away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Close up there, my men!&rsquo; says Inspector Field to
two constables on duty who have followed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep
together, gentlemen; we are going down here.&nbsp;
Heads!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saint Giles&rsquo;s church strikes half-past ten.&nbsp; We
stoop low, and creep down a precipitous flight of steps into a
dark close cellar.&nbsp; There is a fire.&nbsp; There is a long
deal table.&nbsp; There are benches.&nbsp; The cellar is full of
company, chiefly very young men in various conditions of dirt and
raggedness.&nbsp; Some are eating supper.&nbsp; There are no
girls or women present.&nbsp; Welcome to Rats&rsquo; Castle,
gentlemen, and to this company of noted thieves!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my lads!&nbsp; How are you, my lads?&nbsp; What
have you been doing to-day?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s some company come
to see you, my lads!&mdash;<i>There&rsquo;s</i> a plate of
beefsteak, sir, for the supper of a fine young man!&nbsp; And
there&rsquo;s a mouth for a steak, sir!&nbsp; Why, I should be
too proud of such a mouth as that, if I had it myself!&nbsp;
Stand up and show it, sir!&nbsp; Take off your cap.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a fine young man for a nice little party,
sir!&nbsp; An&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Field is the bustling speaker.&nbsp; Inspector
Field&rsquo;s eye is the roving eye that searches every corner of
the cellar as he talks.&nbsp; Inspector Field&rsquo;s hand is the
well-known hand that has collared half the people here, and
motioned their brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, male and
female friends, inexorably to New South Wales.&nbsp; Yet
Inspector Field stands in this den, the Sultan of the
place.&nbsp; Every thief here cowers before him, like a schoolboy
before his schoolmaster.&nbsp; All watch him, all answer when
addressed, all laugh at his jokes, all seek to propitiate
him.&nbsp; This cellar company alone&mdash;to say nothing of the
crowd surrounding the entrance from the street above, and making
the steps shine with eyes&mdash;is strong enough to murder us
all, and willing enough to do it; but, let Inspector Field have a
mind to pick out one thief here, and take him; let him produce
that ghostly truncheon from his pocket, and say, with his
business-air, &lsquo;My lad, I want you!&rsquo; and all
Rats&rsquo; Castle shall be stricken with paralysis, and not a
finger move against him, as he fits the handcuffs on!</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the Earl of Warwick?&mdash;Here he is, Mr.
Field!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the Earl of Warwick, Mr. Field!&mdash;O
there you are, my Lord.&nbsp; Come for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a chest, sir, not to have a clean shirt on.&nbsp;
An&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Take your hat off, my Lord.&nbsp; Why, I
should be ashamed if I was you&mdash;and an Earl, too&mdash;to
show myself to a gentleman with my hat on!&mdash;The Earl of
Warwick laughs and uncovers.&nbsp; All the company laugh.&nbsp;
One pickpocket, especially, laughs with great enthusiasm.&nbsp; O
what a jolly game it is, when Mr. Field comes down&mdash;and
don&rsquo;t want nobody!</p>
<p>So, you are here, too, are you, you tall, grey,
soldierly-looking, grave man, standing by the fire?&mdash;Yes,
sir.&nbsp; Good evening, Mr. Field!&mdash;Let us see.&nbsp; You
lived servant to a nobleman once?&mdash;Yes, Mr. Field.&mdash;And
what is it you do now; I forget?&mdash;Well, Mr. Field, I job
about as well as I can.&nbsp; I left my employment on account of
delicate health.&nbsp; The family is still kind to me.&nbsp; Mr.
Wix of Piccadilly is also very kind to me when I am hard
up.&nbsp; Likewise Mr. Nix of Oxford Street.&nbsp; I get a trifle
from them occasionally, and rub on as well as I can, Mr.
Field.&nbsp; Mr. Field&rsquo;s eye rolls enjoyingly, for this man
is a notorious begging-letter writer.&mdash;Good night, my
lads!&mdash;Good night, Mr. Field, and thank&rsquo;ee, sir!</p>
<p>Clear the street here, half a thousand of you!&nbsp; Cut it,
Mrs. Stalker&mdash;none of that&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want
you!&nbsp; Rogers of the flaming eye, lead on to the
tramps&rsquo; lodging-house!</p>
<p>A dream of baleful faces attends to the door.&nbsp; Now, stand
back all of you!&nbsp; In the rear Detective Sergeant plants
himself, composedly whistling, with his strong right arm across
the narrow passage.&nbsp; Mrs. Stalker, I am something&rsquo;d
that need not be written here, if you won&rsquo;t get yourself
into trouble, in about half a minute, if I see that face of yours
again!</p>
<p>Saint Giles&rsquo;s church clock, striking eleven, hums
through our hand from the dilapidated door of a dark outhouse as
we open it, and are stricken back by the pestilent breath that
issues from within.&nbsp; Rogers to the front with the light, and
let us look!</p>
<p>Ten, twenty, thirty&mdash;who can count them!&nbsp; Men,
women, children, for the most part naked, heaped upon the floor
like maggots in a cheese!&nbsp; Ho!&nbsp; In that dark corner
yonder!&nbsp; Does anybody lie there?&nbsp; Me sir, Irish me, a
widder, with six children.&nbsp; And yonder?&nbsp; Me sir, Irish
me, with me wife and eight poor babes.&nbsp; And to the left
there?&nbsp; Me sir, Irish me, along with two more Irish boys as
is me friends.&nbsp; And to the right there?&nbsp; Me sir and the
Murphy fam&rsquo;ly, numbering five blessed souls.&nbsp; And
what&rsquo;s this, coiling, now, about my foot?&nbsp; Another
Irish me, pitifully in want of shaving, whom I have awakened from
sleep&mdash;and across my other foot lies his wife&mdash;and by
the shoes of Inspector Field lie their three eldest&mdash;and
their three youngest are at present squeezed between the open
door and the wall.&nbsp; And why is there no one on that little
mat before the sullen fire?&nbsp; Because O&rsquo;Donovan, with
his wife and daughter, is not come in from selling
Lucifers!&nbsp; Nor on the bit of sacking in the nearest
corner?&nbsp; Bad luck!&nbsp; Because that Irish family is late
to-night, a-cadging in the streets!</p>
<p>They are all awake now, the children excepted, and most of
them sit up, to stare.&nbsp; Wheresoever Mr. Rogers turns the
flaming eye, there is a spectral figure rising, unshrouded, from
a grave of rags.&nbsp; Who is the landlord here?&mdash;I am, Mr.
Field! says a bundle of ribs and parchment against the wall,
scratching itself.&mdash;Will you spend this money fairly, in the
morning, to buy coffee for &rsquo;em all?&mdash;Yes, sir, I
will!&mdash;O he&rsquo;ll do it, sir, he&rsquo;ll do it
fair.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s honest! cry the spectres.&nbsp; And with
thanks and Good Night sink into their graves again.</p>
<p>Thus, we make our New Oxford Streets, and our other new
streets, never heeding, never asking, where the wretches whom we
clear out, crowd.&nbsp; With such scenes at our doors, with all
the plagues of Egypt tied up with bits of cobweb in kennels so
near our homes, we timorously make our Nuisance Bills and Boards
of Health, nonentities, and think to keep away the Wolves of
Crime and Filth, by our electioneering ducking to little
vestrymen and our gentlemanly handling of Red Tape!</p>
<p>Intelligence of the coffee-money has got abroad.&nbsp; The
yard is full, and Rogers of the flaming eye is beleaguered with
entreaties to show other Lodging Houses.&nbsp; Mine next!&nbsp;
Mine!&nbsp; Mine!&nbsp; Rogers, military, obdurate, stiff-necked,
immovable, replies not, but leads away; all falling back before
him.&nbsp; Inspector Field follows.&nbsp; Detective Sergeant,
with his barrier of arm across the little passage, deliberately
waits to close the procession.&nbsp; He sees behind him, without
any effort, and exceedingly disturbs one individual far in the
rear by coolly calling out, &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Mr.
Michael!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t try it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After council holden in the street, we enter other
lodging-houses, public-houses, many lairs and holes; all noisome
and offensive; none so filthy and so crowded as where Irish
are.&nbsp; In one, The Ethiopian party are expected home
presently&mdash;were in Oxford Street when last heard
of&mdash;shall be fetched, for our delight, within ten
minutes.&nbsp; In another, one of the two or three Professors who
drew Napoleon Buonaparte and a couple of mackerel, on the
pavement and then let the work of art out to a speculator, is
refreshing after his labours.&nbsp; In another, the vested
interest of the profitable nuisance has been in one family for a
hundred years, and the landlord drives in comfortably from the
country to his snug little stew in town.&nbsp; In all, Inspector
Field is received with warmth.&nbsp; Coiners and smashers droop
before him; pickpockets defer to him; the gentle sex (not very
gentle here) smile upon him.&nbsp; Half-drunken hags check
themselves in the midst of pots of beer, or pints of gin, to
drink to Mr. Field, and pressingly to ask the honour of his
finishing the draught.&nbsp; One beldame in rusty black has such
admiration for him, that she runs a whole street&rsquo;s length
to shake him by the hand; tumbling into a heap of mud by the way,
and still pressing her attentions when her very form has ceased
to be distinguishable through it.&nbsp; Before the power of the
law, the power of superior sense&mdash;for common thieves are
fools beside these men&mdash;and the power of a perfect mastery
of their character, the garrison of Rats&rsquo; Castle and the
adjacent Fortresses make but a skulking show indeed when reviewed
by Inspector Field.</p>
<p>Saint Giles&rsquo;s clock says it will be midnight in
half-an-hour, and Inspector Field says we must hurry to the Old
Mint in the Borough.&nbsp; The cab-driver is low-spirited, and
has a solemn sense of his responsibility.&nbsp; Now, what&rsquo;s
your fare, my lad?&mdash;O you know, Inspector Field,
what&rsquo;s the good of asking me!</p>
<p>Say, Parker, strapped and great-coated, and waiting in dim
Borough doorway by appointment, to replace the trusty Rogers whom
we left deep in Saint Giles&rsquo;s, are you ready?&nbsp; Ready,
Inspector Field, and at a motion of my wrist behold my flaming
eye.</p>
<p>This narrow street, sir, is the chief part of the Old Mint,
full of low lodging-houses, as you see by the transparent
canvas-lamps and blinds, announcing beds for travellers!&nbsp;
But it is greatly changed, friend Field, from my former knowledge
of it; it is infinitely quieter and more subdued than when I was
here last, some seven years ago?&nbsp; O yes!&nbsp; Inspector
Haynes, a first-rate man, is on this station now and plays the
Devil with them!</p>
<p>Well, my lads!&nbsp; How are you to-night, my lads?&nbsp;
Playing cards here, eh?&nbsp; Who wins?&mdash;Why, Mr. Field, I,
the sulky gentleman with the damp flat side-curls, rubbing my
bleared eye with the end of my neckerchief which is like a dirty
eel-skin, am losing just at present, but I suppose I must take my
pipe out of my mouth, and be submissive to <i>you</i>&mdash;I
hope I see you well, Mr. Field?&mdash;Aye, all right, my
lad.&nbsp; Deputy, who have you got up-stairs?&nbsp; Be pleased
to show the rooms!</p>
<p>Why Deputy, Inspector Field can&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; He only
knows that the man who takes care of the beds and lodgers is
always called so.&nbsp; Steady, O Deputy, with the flaring candle
in the blacking-bottle, for this is a slushy back-yard, and the
wooden staircase outside the house creaks and has holes in
it.</p>
<p>Again, in these confined intolerable rooms, burrowed out like
the holes of rats or the nests of insect-vermin, but fuller of
intolerable smells, are crowds of sleepers, each on his foul
truckle-bed coiled up beneath a rug.&nbsp; Holloa here!&nbsp;
Come!&nbsp; Let us see you!&nbsp; Show your face!&nbsp; Pilot
Parker goes from bed to bed and turns their slumbering heads
towards us, as a salesman might turn sheep.&nbsp; Some wake up
with an execration and a threat.&mdash;What! who spoke?&nbsp;
O!&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s the accursed glaring eye that fixes me, go
where I will, I am helpless.&nbsp; Here!&nbsp; I sit up to be
looked at.&nbsp; Is it me you want?&nbsp; Not you, lie down
again! and I lie down, with a woful growl.</p>
<p>Whenever the turning lane of light becomes stationary for a
moment, some sleeper appears at the end of it, submits himself to
be scrutinised, and fades away into the darkness.</p>
<p>There should be strange dreams here, Deputy.&nbsp; They sleep
sound enough, says Deputy, taking the candle out of the
blacking-bottle, snuffing it with his fingers, throwing the snuff
into the bottle, and corking it up with the candle; that&rsquo;s
all <i>I</i> know.&nbsp; What is the inscription, Deputy, on all
the discoloured sheets?&nbsp; A precaution against loss of
linen.&nbsp; Deputy turns down the rug of an unoccupied bed and
discloses it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Stop Thief</span>!</p>
<p>To lie at night, wrapped in the legend of my slinking life; to
take the cry that pursues me, waking, to my breast in sleep; to
have it staring at me, and clamouring for me, as soon as
consciousness returns; to have it for my first-foot on
New-Year&rsquo;s day, my Valentine, my Birthday salute, my
Christmas greeting, my parting with the old year.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Stop Thief</span>!</p>
<p>And to know that I <i>must</i> be stopped, come what
will.&nbsp; To know that I am no match for this individual energy
and keenness, or this organised and steady system!&nbsp; Come
across the street, here, and, entering by a little shop and yard,
examine these intricate passages and doors, contrived for escape,
flapping and counter-flapping, like the lids of the
conjurer&rsquo;s boxes.&nbsp; But what avail they?&nbsp; Who gets
in by a nod, and shows their secret working to us?&nbsp;
Inspector Field.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the old Farm House, Parker!&nbsp; Parker is
not the man to forget it.&nbsp; We are going there, now.&nbsp; It
is the old Manor-House of these parts, and stood in the country
once.&nbsp; Then, perhaps, there was something, which was not the
beastly street, to see from the shattered low fronts of the
overhanging wooden houses we are passing under&mdash;shut up now,
pasted over with bills about the literature and drama of the
Mint, and mouldering away.&nbsp; This long paved yard was a
paddock or a garden once, or a court in front of the Farm
House.&nbsp; Perchance, with a dovecot in the centre, and fowls
peeking about&mdash;with fair elm trees, then, where discoloured
chimney-stacks and gables are now&mdash;noisy, then, with rooks
which have yielded to a different sort of rookery.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s likelier than not, Inspector Field thinks, as we turn
into the common kitchen, which is in the yard, and many paces
from the house.</p>
<p>Well, my lads and lasses, how are you all?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Blackey, who has stood near London Bridge these five-and-twenty
years, with a painted skin to represent disease?&mdash;Here he
is, Mr. Field!&mdash;How are you, Blackey?&mdash;Jolly, sa!&nbsp;
Not playing the fiddle to-night, Blackey?&mdash;Not a night,
sa!&nbsp; A sharp, smiling youth, the wit of the kitchen,
interposes.&nbsp; He an&rsquo;t musical to-night, sir.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been giving him a moral lecture; I&rsquo;ve been a
talking to him about his latter end, you see.&nbsp; A good many
of these are my pupils, sir.&nbsp; This here young man (smoothing
down the hair of one near him, reading a Sunday paper) is a pupil
of mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a teaching of him to read, sir.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a promising cove, sir.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a smith, he
is, and gets his living by the sweat of the brow, sir.&nbsp; So
do I, myself, sir.&nbsp; This young woman is my sister, Mr.
Field.&nbsp; <i>She&rsquo;s</i> getting on very well too.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a deal of trouble with &rsquo;em, sir, but I&rsquo;m
richly rewarded, now I see &rsquo;em all a doing so well, and
growing up so creditable.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a great comfort,
that is, an&rsquo;t it, sir?&mdash;In the midst of the kitchen
(the whole kitchen is in ecstasies with this impromptu
&lsquo;chaff&rsquo;) sits a young, modest, gentle-looking
creature, with a beautiful child in her lap.&nbsp; She seems to
belong to the company, but is so strangely unlike it.&nbsp; She
has such a pretty, quiet face and voice, and is so proud to hear
the child admired&mdash;thinks you would hardly believe that he
is only nine months old!&nbsp; Is she as bad as the rest, I
wonder?&nbsp; Inspectorial experience does not engender a belief
contrariwise, but prompts the answer, Not a ha&rsquo;porth of
difference!</p>
<p>There is a piano going in the old Farm House as we
approach.&nbsp; It stops.&nbsp; Landlady appears.&nbsp; Has no
objections, Mr. Field, to gentlemen being brought, but wishes it
were at earlier hours, the lodgers complaining of
ill-conwenience.&nbsp; Inspector Field is polite and
soothing&mdash;knows his woman and the sex.&nbsp; Deputy (a girl
in this case) shows the way up a heavy, broad old staircase, kept
very clean, into clean rooms where many sleepers are, and where
painted panels of an older time look strangely on the truckle
beds.&nbsp; The sight of whitewash and the smell of
soap&mdash;two things we seem by this time to have parted from in
infancy&mdash;make the old Farm House a phenomenon, and connect
themselves with the so curiously misplaced picture of the pretty
mother and child long after we have left it,&mdash;long after we
have left, besides, the neighbouring nook with something of a
rustic flavour in it yet, where once, beneath a low wooden
colonnade still standing as of yore, the eminent Jack Sheppard
condescended to regale himself, and where, now, two old bachelor
brothers in broad hats (who are whispered in the Mint to have
made a compact long ago that if either should ever marry, he must
forfeit his share of the joint property) still keep a sequestered
tavern, and sit o&rsquo; nights smoking pipes in the bar, among
ancient bottles and glasses, as our eyes behold them.</p>
<p>How goes the night now?&nbsp; Saint George of Southwark
answers with twelve blows upon his bell.&nbsp; Parker, good
night, for Williams is already waiting over in the region of
Ratcliffe Highway, to show the houses where the sailors
dance.</p>
<p>I should like to know where Inspector Field was born.&nbsp; In
Ratcliffe Highway, I would have answered with confidence, but for
his being equally at home wherever we go.&nbsp; <i>He</i> does
not trouble his head as I do, about the river at night.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> does not care for its creeping, black and silent, on
our right there, rushing through sluice-gates, lapping at piles
and posts and iron rings, hiding strange things in its mud,
running away with suicides and accidentally drowned bodies faster
than midnight funeral should, and acquiring such various
experience between its cradle and its grave.&nbsp; It has no
mystery for him.&nbsp; Is there not the Thames Police!</p>
<p>Accordingly, Williams leads the way.&nbsp; We are a little
late, for some of the houses are already closing.&nbsp; No
matter.&nbsp; You show us plenty.&nbsp; All the landlords know
Inspector Field.&nbsp; All pass him, freely and good-humouredly,
wheresoever he wants to go.&nbsp; So thoroughly are all these
houses open to him and our local guide, that, granting that
sailors must be entertained in their own way&mdash;as I suppose
they must, and have a right to be&mdash;I hardly know how such
places could be better regulated.&nbsp; Not that I call the
company very select, or the dancing very graceful&mdash;even so
graceful as that of the German Sugar Bakers, whose assembly, by
the Minories, we stopped to visit&mdash;but there is watchful
maintenance of order in every house, and swift expulsion where
need is.&nbsp; Even in the midst of drunkenness, both of the
lethargic kind and the lively, there is sharp landlord
supervision, and pockets are in less peril than out of
doors.&nbsp; These houses show, singularly, how much of the
picturesque and romantic there truly is in the sailor, requiring
to be especially addressed.&nbsp; All the songs (sung in a
hailstorm of halfpence, which are pitched at the singer without
the least tenderness for the time or tune&mdash;mostly from great
rolls of copper carried for the purpose&mdash;and which he
occasionally dodges like shot as they fly near his head) are of
the sentimental sea sort.&nbsp; All the rooms are decorated with
nautical subjects.&nbsp; Wrecks, engagements, ships on fire,
ships passing lighthouses on iron-bound coasts, ships blowing up,
ships going down, ships running ashore, men lying out upon the
main-yard in a gale of wind, sailors and ships in every variety
of peril, constitute the illustrations of fact.&nbsp; Nothing can
be done in the fanciful way, without a thumping boy upon a scaly
dolphin.</p>
<p>How goes the night now?&nbsp; Past one.&nbsp; Black and Green
are waiting in Whitechapel to unveil the mysteries of Wentworth
Street.&nbsp; Williams, the best of friends must part.&nbsp;
Adieu!</p>
<p>Are not Black and Green ready at the appointed place?&nbsp; O
yes!&nbsp; They glide out of shadow as we stop.&nbsp;
Imperturbable Black opens the cab-door; Imperturbable Green takes
a mental note of the driver.&nbsp; Both Green and Black then open
each his flaming eye, and marshal us the way that we are
going.</p>
<p>The lodging-house we want is hidden in a maze of streets and
courts.&nbsp; It is fast shut.&nbsp; We knock at the door, and
stand hushed looking up for a light at one or other of the
begrimed old lattice windows in its ugly front, when another
constable comes up&mdash;supposes that we want &lsquo;to see the
school.&rsquo;&nbsp; Detective Sergeant meanwhile has got over a
rail, opened a gate, dropped down an area, overcome some other
little obstacles, and tapped at a window.&nbsp; Now
returns.&nbsp; The landlord will send a deputy immediately.</p>
<p>Deputy is heard to stumble out of bed.&nbsp; Deputy lights a
candle, draws back a bolt or two, and appears at the door.&nbsp;
Deputy is a shivering shirt and trousers by no means clean, a
yawning face, a shock head much confused externally and
internally.&nbsp; We want to look for some one.&nbsp; You may go
up with the light, and take &rsquo;em all, if you like, says
Deputy, resigning it, and sitting down upon a bench in the
kitchen with his ten fingers sleepily twisting in his hair.</p>
<p>Halloa here!&nbsp; Now then!&nbsp; Show yourselves.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
disturb yourself any more!&nbsp; So on, through a labyrinth of
airless rooms, each man responding, like a wild beast, to the
keeper who has tamed him, and who goes into his cage.&nbsp; What,
you haven&rsquo;t found him, then? says Deputy, when we came
down.&nbsp; A woman mysteriously sitting up all night in the dark
by the smouldering ashes of the kitchen fire, says it&rsquo;s
only tramps and cadgers here; it&rsquo;s gonophs over the
way.&nbsp; A man mysteriously walking about the kitchen all night
in the dark, bids her hold her tongue.&nbsp; We come out.&nbsp;
Deputy fastens the door and goes to bed again.</p>
<p>Black and Green, you know Bark, lodging-house keeper and
receiver of stolen goods?&mdash;O yes, Inspector Field.&mdash;Go
to Bark&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>Bark sleeps in an inner wooden hutch, near his street
door.&nbsp; As we parley on the step with Bark&rsquo;s Deputy,
Bark growls in his bed.&nbsp; We enter, and Bark flies out of
bed.&nbsp; Bark is a red villain and a wrathful, with a sanguine
throat that looks very much as if it were expressly made for
hanging, as he stretches it out, in pale defiance, over the
half-door of his hutch.&nbsp; Bark&rsquo;s parts of speech are of
an awful sort&mdash;principally adjectives.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t,
says Bark, have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my
adjective premises!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t, by adjective and
substantive!&nbsp; Give me my trousers, and I&rsquo;ll send the
whole adjective police to adjective and substantive!&nbsp; Give
me, says Bark, my adjective trousers!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put an
adjective knife in the whole bileing of &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll punch their adjective heads.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll rip up
their adjective substantives.&nbsp; Give me my adjective
trousers! says Bark, and I&rsquo;ll spile the bileing of
&rsquo;em!</p>
<p>Now, Bark, what&rsquo;s the use of this?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
Black and Green, Detective Sergeant, and Inspector Field.&nbsp;
You know we will come in.&mdash;I know you won&rsquo;t! says
Bark.&nbsp; Somebody give me my adjective trousers!&nbsp;
Bark&rsquo;s trousers seem difficult to find.&nbsp; He calls for
them as Hercules might for his club.&nbsp; Give me my adjective
trousers! says Bark, and I&rsquo;ll spile the bileing of
&rsquo;em!</p>
<p>Inspector Field holds that it&rsquo;s all one whether Bark
likes the visit or don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; He, Inspector
Field, is an Inspector of the Detective Police, Detective
Sergeant is Detective Sergeant, Black and Green are constables in
uniform.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you be a fool, Bark, or you know it
will be the worse for you.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care, says
Bark.&nbsp; Give me my adjective trousers!</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, we descend into
Bark&rsquo;s low kitchen, leaving Bark to foam at the mouth
above, and Imperturbable Black and Green to look at him.&nbsp;
Bark&rsquo;s kitchen is crammed full of thieves, holding a
conversazione there by lamp-light.&nbsp; It is by far the most
dangerous assembly we have seen yet.&nbsp; Stimulated by the
ravings of Bark, above, their looks are sullen, but not a man
speaks.&nbsp; We ascend again.&nbsp; Bark has got his trousers,
and is in a state of madness in the passage with his back against
a door that shuts off the upper staircase.&nbsp; We observe, in
other respects, a ferocious individuality in Bark.&nbsp; Instead
of &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Stop Thief</span>!&rsquo; on his
linen, he prints &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Stolen from</span>
Bark&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, Bark, we are going up-stairs!&mdash;No, you
ain&rsquo;t!&mdash;You refuse admission to the Police, do you,
Bark?&mdash;Yes, I do!&nbsp; I refuse it to all the adjective
police, and to all the adjective substantives.&nbsp; If the
adjective coves in the kitchen was men, they&rsquo;d come up now,
and do for you!&nbsp; Shut me that there door! says Bark, and
suddenly we are enclosed in the passage.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d come
up and do for you! cries Bark, and waits.&nbsp; Not a sound in
the kitchen!&nbsp; They&rsquo;d come up and do for you! cries
Bark again, and waits.&nbsp; Not a sound in the kitchen!&nbsp; We
are shut up, half-a-dozen of us, in Bark&rsquo;s house in the
innermost recesses of the worst part of London, in the dead of
the night&mdash;the house is crammed with notorious robbers and
ruffians&mdash;and not a man stirs.&nbsp; No, Bark.&nbsp; They
know the weight of the law, and they know Inspector Field and Co.
too well.</p>
<p>We leave bully Bark to subside at leisure out of his passion
and his trousers, and, I dare say, to be inconveniently reminded
of this little brush before long.&nbsp; Black and Green do
ordinary duty here, and look serious.</p>
<p>As to White, who waits on Holborn Hill to show the courts that
are eaten out of Rotten Gray&rsquo;s Inn, Lane, where other
lodging-houses are, and where (in one blind alley) the
Thieves&rsquo; Kitchen and Seminary for the teaching of the art
to children is, the night has so worn away, being now</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">almost at odds with
morning, which is which,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that they are quiet, and no light shines through the chinks in
the shutters.&nbsp; As undistinctive Death will come here, one
day, sleep comes now.&nbsp; The wicked cease from troubling
sometimes, even in this life.</p>
<h2><a name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 442</span>DOWN
WITH THE TIDE</h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">VERY</span> dark night it was, and
bitter cold; the east wind blowing bleak, and bringing with it
stinging particles from marsh, and moor, and fen&mdash;from the
Great Desert and Old Egypt, may be.&nbsp; Some of the component
parts of the sharp-edged vapour that came flying up the Thames at
London might be mummy-dust, dry atoms from the Temple at
Jerusalem, camels&rsquo; foot-prints, crocodiles&rsquo;
hatching-places, loosened grains of expression from the visages
of blunt-nosed sphynxes, waifs and strays from caravans of
turbaned merchants, vegetation from jungles, frozen snow from the
Himalayas.&nbsp; O!&nbsp; It was very, very dark upon the Thames,
and it was bitter, bitter cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said the voice within the great
pea-coat at my side, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll have seen a good many
rivers, too, I dare say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;when I come to think of
it, not a few.&nbsp; From the Niagara, downward to the mountain
rivers of Italy, which are like the national spirit&mdash;very
tame, or chafing suddenly and bursting bounds, only to dwindle
away again.&nbsp; The Moselle, and the Rhine, and the Rhone; and
the Seine, and the Saone; and the St. Lawrence, Mississippi, and
Ohio; and the Tiber, the Po, and the Arno; and
the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peacoat coughing as if he had had enough of that, I said no
more.&nbsp; I could have carried the catalogue on to a teasing
length, though, if I had been in the cruel mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And after all,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this looks so
dismal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So awful,&rsquo; I returned, &lsquo;at night.&nbsp; The
Seine at Paris is very gloomy too, at such a time, and is
probably the scene of far more crime and greater wickedness; but
this river looks so broad and vast, so murky and silent, seems
such an image of death in the midst of the great city&rsquo;s
life, that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>That Peacoat coughed again.&nbsp; He <i>could not</i> stand my
holding forth.</p>
<p>We were in a four-oared Thames Police Galley, lying on our
oars in the deep shadow of Southwark Bridge&mdash;under the
corner arch on the Surrey side&mdash;having come down with the
tide from Vauxhall.&nbsp; We were fain to hold on pretty tight,
though close in shore, for the river was swollen and the tide
running down very strong.&nbsp; We were watching certain
water-rats of human growth, and lay in the deep shade as quiet as
mice; our light hidden and our scraps of conversation carried on
in whispers.&nbsp; Above us, the massive iron girders of the arch
were faintly visible, and below us its ponderous shadow seemed to
sink down to the bottom of the stream.</p>
<p>We had been lying here some half an hour.&nbsp; With our backs
to the wind, it is true; but the wind being in a determined
temper blew straight through us, and would not take the trouble
to go round.&nbsp; I would have boarded a fireship to get into
action, and mildly suggested as much to my friend Pea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; says he as patiently as possible;
&lsquo;but shore-going tactics wouldn&rsquo;t do with us.&nbsp;
River-thieves can always get rid of stolen property in a moment
by dropping it overboard.&nbsp; We want to take them with the
property, so we lurk about and come out upon &rsquo;em
sharp.&nbsp; If they see us or hear us, over it goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pea&rsquo;s wisdom being indisputable, there was nothing for
it but to sit there and be blown through, for another
half-hour.&nbsp; The water-rats thinking it wise to abscond at
the end of that time without commission of felony, we shot out,
disappointed, with the tide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Grim they look, don&rsquo;t they?&rsquo; said Pea,
seeing me glance over my shoulder at the lights upon the bridge,
and downward at their long crooked reflections in the river.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and make one think with a
shudder of Suicides.&nbsp; What a night for a dreadful leap from
that parapet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, but Waterloo&rsquo;s the favourite bridge for
making holes in the water from,&rsquo; returned Pea.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By the bye&mdash;avast pulling, lads!&mdash;would you like
to speak to Waterloo on the subject?&rsquo;</p>
<p>My face confessing a surprised desire to have some friendly
conversation with Waterloo Bridge, and my friend Pea being the
most obliging of men, we put about, pulled out of the force of
the stream, and in place of going at great speed with the tide,
began to strive against it, close in shore again.&nbsp; Every
colour but black seemed to have departed from the world.&nbsp;
The air was black, the water was black, the barges and hulks were
black, the piles were black, the buildings were black, the
shadows were only a deeper shade of black upon a black
ground.&nbsp; Here and there, a coal fire in an iron cresset
blazed upon a wharf; but, one knew that it too had been black a
little while ago, and would be black again soon.&nbsp;
Uncomfortable rushes of water suggestive of gurgling and
drowning, ghostly rattlings of iron chains, dismal clankings of
discordant engines, formed the music that accompanied the dip of
our oars and their rattling in the rowlocks.&nbsp; Even the
noises had a black sound to me&mdash;as the trumpet sounded red
to the blind man.</p>
<p>Our dexterous boat&rsquo;s crew made nothing of the tide, and
pulled us gallantly up to Waterloo Bridge.&nbsp; Here Pea and I
disembarked, passed under the black stone archway, and climbed
the steep stone steps.&nbsp; Within a few feet of their summit,
Pea presented me to Waterloo (or an eminent toll-taker
representing that structure), muffled up to the eyes in a thick
shawl, and amply great-coated and fur-capped.</p>
<p>Waterloo received us with cordiality, and observed of the
night that it was &lsquo;a Searcher.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had been
originally called the Strand Bridge, he informed us, but had
received his present name at the suggestion of the proprietors,
when Parliament had resolved to vote three hundred thousand pound
for the erection of a monument in honour of the victory.&nbsp;
Parliament took the hint (said Waterloo, with the least flavour
of misanthropy) and saved the money.&nbsp; Of course the late
Duke of Wellington was the first passenger, and of course he paid
his penny, and of course a noble lord preserved it
evermore.&nbsp; The treadle and index at the toll-house (a most
ingenious contrivance for rendering fraud impossible), were
invented by Mr. Lethbridge, then property-man at Drury Lane
Theatre.</p>
<p>Was it suicide, we wanted to know about? said Waterloo.&nbsp;
Ha!&nbsp; Well, he had seen a good deal of that work, he did
assure us.&nbsp; He had prevented some.&nbsp; Why, one day a
woman, poorish looking, came in between the hatch, slapped down a
penny, and wanted to go on without the change!&nbsp; Waterloo
suspected this, and says to his mate, &lsquo;give an eye to the
gate,&rsquo; and bolted after her.&nbsp; She had got to the third
seat between the piers, and was on the parapet just a going over,
when he caught her and gave her in charge.&nbsp; At the police
office next morning, she said it was along of trouble and a bad
husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Likely enough,&rsquo; observed Waterloo to Pea and
myself, as he adjusted his chin in his shawl.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a deal of trouble about, you see&mdash;and
bad husbands too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another time, a young woman at twelve o&rsquo;clock in the
open day, got through, darted along; and, before Waterloo could
come near her, jumped upon the parapet, and shot herself over
sideways.&nbsp; Alarm given, watermen put off, lucky
escape.&mdash;Clothes buoyed her up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is where it is,&rsquo; said Waterloo.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If people jump off straight forwards from the middle of
the parapet of the bays of the bridge, they are seldom killed by
drowning, but are smashed, poor things; that&rsquo;s what they
are; they dash themselves upon the buttress of the bridge.&nbsp;
But you jump off,&rsquo; said Waterloo to me, putting his
fore-finger in a button-hole of my great-coat; &lsquo;you jump
off from the side of the bay, and you&rsquo;ll tumble, true, into
the stream under the arch.&nbsp; What you have got to do, is to
mind how you jump in!&nbsp; There was poor Tom Steele from
Dublin.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t dive!&nbsp; Bless you, didn&rsquo;t
dive at all!&nbsp; Fell down so flat into the water, that he
broke his breast-bone, and lived two days!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I asked Waterloo if there were a favourite side of his bridge
for this dreadful purpose?&nbsp; He reflected, and thought yes,
there was.&nbsp; He should say the Surrey side.</p>
<p>Three decent-looking men went through one day, soberly and
quietly, and went on abreast for about a dozen yards: when the
middle one, he sung out, all of a sudden, &lsquo;Here goes,
Jack!&rsquo; and was over in a minute.</p>
<p>Body found?&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Waterloo didn&rsquo;t rightly
recollect about that.&nbsp; They were compositors, <i>they</i>
were.</p>
<p>He considered it astonishing how quick people were!&nbsp; Why,
there was a cab came up one Boxing-night, with a young woman in
it, who looked, according to Waterloo&rsquo;s opinion of her, a
little the worse for liquor; very handsome she was too&mdash;very
handsome.&nbsp; She stopped the cab at the gate, and said
she&rsquo;d pay the cabman then, which she did, though there was
a little hankering about the fare, because at first she
didn&rsquo;t seem quite to know where she wanted to be drove
to.&nbsp; However, she paid the man, and the toll too, and
looking Waterloo in the face (he thought she knew him,
don&rsquo;t you see!) said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll finish it
somehow!&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, the cab went off, leaving Waterloo a
little doubtful in his mind, and while it was going on at full
speed the young woman jumped out, never fell, hardly staggered,
ran along the bridge pavement a little way, passing several
people, and jumped over from the second opening.&nbsp; At the
inquest it was giv&rsquo; in evidence that she had been
quarrelling at the Hero of Waterloo, and it was brought in
jealousy.&nbsp; (One of the results of Waterloo&rsquo;s
experience was, that there was a deal of jealousy about.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do we ever get madmen?&rsquo; said Waterloo, in answer
to an inquiry of mine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, we <i>do</i> get
madmen.&nbsp; Yes, we have had one or two; escaped from
&lsquo;Sylums, I suppose.&nbsp; One hadn&rsquo;t a halfpenny; and
because I wouldn&rsquo;t let him through, he went back a little
way, stooped down, took a run, and butted at the hatch like a
ram.&nbsp; He smashed his hat rarely, but his head didn&rsquo;t
seem no worse&mdash;in my opinion on account of his being wrong
in it afore.&nbsp; Sometimes people haven&rsquo;t got a
halfpenny.&nbsp; If they are really tired and poor we give
&rsquo;em one and let &rsquo;em through.&nbsp; Other people will
leave things&mdash;pocket-handkerchiefs mostly.&nbsp; I have
taken cravats and gloves, pocket-knives, tooth-picks, studs,
shirt-pins, rings (generally from young gents, early in the
morning), but handkerchiefs is the general thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Regular customers?&rsquo; said Waterloo.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lord, yes!&nbsp; We have regular customers.&nbsp; One,
such a worn-out, used-up old file as you can scarcely picter,
comes from the Surrey side as regular as ten o&rsquo;clock at
night comes; and goes over, <i>I</i> think, to some flash house
on the Middlesex side.&nbsp; He comes back, he does, as
reg&rsquo;lar as the clock strikes three in the morning, and then
can hardly drag one of his old legs after the other.&nbsp; He
always turns down the water-stairs, comes up again, and then goes
on down the Waterloo Road.&nbsp; He always does the same thing,
and never varies a minute.&nbsp; Does it every night&mdash;even
Sundays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I asked Waterloo if he had given his mind to the possibility
of this particular customer going down the water-stairs at three
o&rsquo;clock some morning, and never coming up again?&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t think that of him, he replied.&nbsp; In fact, it was
Waterloo&rsquo;s opinion, founded on his observation of that
file, that he know&rsquo;d a trick worth two of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s another queer old customer,&rsquo; said
Waterloo, &lsquo;comes over, as punctual as the almanack, at
eleven o&rsquo;clock on the sixth of January, at eleven
o&rsquo;clock on the fifth of April, at eleven o&rsquo;clock on
the sixth of July, at eleven o&rsquo;clock on the tenth of
October.&nbsp; Drives a shaggy little, rough pony, in a sort of a
rattle-trap arm-chair sort of a thing.&nbsp; White hair he has,
and white whiskers, and muffles himself up with all manner of
shawls.&nbsp; He comes back again the same afternoon, and we
never see more of him for three months.&nbsp; He is a captain in
the navy&mdash;retired&mdash;wery old&mdash;wery odd&mdash;and
served with Lord Nelson.&nbsp; He is particular about drawing his
pension at Somerset House afore the clock strikes twelve every
quarter.&nbsp; I have heerd say that he thinks it wouldn&rsquo;t
be according to the Act of Parliament, if he didn&rsquo;t draw it
afore twelve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having related these anecdotes in a natural manner, which was
the best warranty in the world for their genuine nature, our
friend Waterloo was sinking deep into his shawl again, as having
exhausted his communicative powers and taken in enough east wind,
when my other friend Pea in a moment brought him to the surface
by asking whether he had not been occasionally the subject of
assault and battery in the execution of his duty?&nbsp; Waterloo
recovering his spirits, instantly dashed into a new branch of his
subject.&nbsp; We learnt how &lsquo;both these
teeth&rsquo;&mdash;here he pointed to the places where two front
teeth were not&mdash;were knocked out by an ugly customer who one
night made a dash at him (Waterloo) while his (the ugly
customer&rsquo;s) pal and coadjutor made a dash at the
toll-taking apron where the money-pockets were; how Waterloo,
letting the teeth go (to Blazes, he observed indefinitely),
grappled with the apron-seizer, permitting the ugly one to run
away; and how he saved the bank, and captured his man, and
consigned him to fine and imprisonment.&nbsp; Also how, on
another night, &lsquo;a Cove&rsquo; laid hold of Waterloo, then
presiding at the horse-gate of his bridge, and threw him
unceremoniously over his knee, having first cut his head open
with his whip.&nbsp; How Waterloo &lsquo;got right,&rsquo; and
started after the Cove all down the Waterloo Road, through
Stamford Street, and round to the foot of Blackfriars Bridge,
where the Cove &lsquo;cut into&rsquo; a public-house.&nbsp; How
Waterloo cut in too; but how an aider and abettor of the
Cove&rsquo;s, who happened to be taking a promiscuous drain at
the bar, stopped Waterloo; and the Cove cut out again, ran across
the road down Holland Street, and where not, and into a
beer-shop.&nbsp; How Waterloo breaking away from his detainer was
close upon the Cove&rsquo;s heels, attended by no end of people,
who, seeing him running with the blood streaming down his face,
thought something worse was &lsquo;up,&rsquo; and roared Fire!
and Murder! on the hopeful chance of the matter in hand being one
or both.&nbsp; How the Cove was ignominiously taken, in a shed
where he had run to hide, and how at the Police Court they at
first wanted to make a sessions job of it; but eventually
Waterloo was allowed to be &lsquo;spoke to,&rsquo; and the Cove
made it square with Waterloo by paying his doctor&rsquo;s bill
(W. was laid up for a week) and giving him &lsquo;Three,
ten.&rsquo;&nbsp; Likewise we learnt what we had faintly
suspected before, that your sporting amateur on the Derby day,
albeit a captain, can be&mdash;&lsquo;if he be,&rsquo; as Captain
Bobadil observes, &lsquo;so generously
minded&rsquo;&mdash;anything but a man of honour and a gentleman;
not sufficiently gratifying his nice sense of humour by the witty
scattering of flour and rotten eggs on obtuse civilians, but
requiring the further excitement of &lsquo;bilking the
toll,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pitching into&rsquo; Waterloo, and
&lsquo;cutting him about the head with his whip;&rsquo; finally
being, when called upon to answer for the assault, what Waterloo
described as &lsquo;Minus,&rsquo; or, as I humbly conceived it,
not to be found.&nbsp; Likewise did Waterloo inform us, in reply
to my inquiries, admiringly and deferentially preferred through
my friend Pea, that the takings at the Bridge had more than
doubled in amount, since the reduction of the toll one
half.&nbsp; And being asked if the aforesaid takings included
much bad money, Waterloo responded, with a look far deeper than
the deepest part of the river, he should think not!&mdash;and so
retired into his shawl for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Then did Pea and I once more embark in our four-oared galley,
and glide swiftly down the river with the tide.&nbsp; And while
the shrewd East rasped and notched us, as with jagged razors, did
my friend Pea impart to me confidences of interest relating to
the Thames Police; we, between whiles, finding &lsquo;duty
boats&rsquo; hanging in dark corners under banks, like
weeds&mdash;our own was a &lsquo;supervision
boat&rsquo;&mdash;and they, as they reported &lsquo;all
right!&rsquo; flashing their hidden light on us, and we flashing
ours on them.&nbsp; These duty boats had one sitter in each: an
Inspector: and were rowed &lsquo;Ran-dan,&rsquo; which&mdash;for
the information of those who never graduated, as I was once proud
to do, under a fireman-waterman and winner of Kean&rsquo;s Prize
Wherry: who, in the course of his tuition, took hundreds of
gallons of rum and egg (at my expense) at the various houses of
note above and below bridge; not by any means because he liked
it, but to cure a weakness in his liver, for which the faculty
had particularly recommended it&mdash;may be explained as rowed
by three men, two pulling an oar each, and one a pair of
sculls.</p>
<p>Thus, floating down our black highway, sullenly frowned upon
by the knitted brows of Blackfriars, Southwark, and London, each
in his lowering turn, I was shown by my friend Pea that there
are, in the Thames Police Force, whose district extends from
Battersea to Barking Creek, ninety-eight men, eight duty boats,
and two supervision boats; and that these go about so silently,
and lie in wait in such dark places, and so seem to be nowhere,
and so may be anywhere, that they have gradually become a police
of prevention, keeping the river almost clear of any great
crimes, even while the increased vigilance on shore has made it
much harder than of yore to live by &lsquo;thieving&rsquo; in the
streets.&nbsp; And as to the various kinds of water-thieves, said
my friend Pea, there were the Tier-rangers, who silently dropped
alongside the tiers of shipping in the Pool, by night, and who,
going to the companion-head, listened for two snores&mdash;snore
number one, the skipper&rsquo;s; snore number two, the
mate&rsquo;s&mdash;mates and skippers always snoring great guns,
and being dead sure to be hard at it if they had turned in and
were asleep.&nbsp; Hearing the double fire, down went the Rangers
into the skippers&rsquo; cabins; groped for the skippers&rsquo;
inexpressibles, which it was the custom of those gentlemen to
shake off, watch, money, braces, boots, and all together, on the
floor; and therewith made off as silently as might be.&nbsp; Then
there were the Lumpers, or labourers employed to unload
vessels.&nbsp; They wore loose canvas jackets with a broad hem in
the bottom, turned inside, so as to form a large circular pocket
in which they could conceal, like clowns in pantomimes, packages
of surprising sizes.&nbsp; A great deal of property was stolen in
this manner (Pea confided to me) from steamers; first, because
steamers carry a larger number of small packages than other
ships; next, because of the extreme rapidity with which they are
obliged to be unladen for their return voyages.&nbsp; The Lumpers
dispose of their booty easily to marine store dealers, and the
only remedy to be suggested is that marine store shops should be
licensed, and thus brought under the eye of the police as rigidly
as public-houses.&nbsp; Lumpers also smuggle goods ashore for the
crews of vessels.&nbsp; The smuggling of tobacco is so
considerable, that it is well worth the while of the sellers of
smuggled tobacco to use hydraulic presses, to squeeze a single
pound into a package small enough to be contained in an ordinary
pocket.&nbsp; Next, said my friend Pea, there were the
Truckers&mdash;less thieves than smugglers, whose business it was
to land more considerable parcels of goods than the Lumpers could
manage.&nbsp; They sometimes sold articles of grocery and so
forth, to the crews, in order to cloak their real calling, and
get aboard without suspicion.&nbsp; Many of them had boats of
their own, and made money.&nbsp; Besides these, there were the
Dredgermen, who, under pretence of dredging up coals and such
like from the bottom of the river, hung about barges and other
undecked craft, and when they saw an opportunity, threw any
property they could lay their hands on overboard: in order slyly
to dredge it up when the vessel was gone.&nbsp; Sometimes, they
dexterously used their dredges to whip away anything that might
lie within reach.&nbsp; Some of them were mighty neat at this,
and the accomplishment was called dry dredging.&nbsp; Then, there
was a vast deal of property, such as copper nails, sheathing,
hardwood, &amp;c., habitually brought away by shipwrights and
other workmen from their employers&rsquo; yards, and disposed of
to marine store dealers, many of whom escaped detection through
hard swearing, and their extraordinary artful ways of accounting
for the possession of stolen property.&nbsp; Likewise, there were
special-pleading practitioners, for whom barges &lsquo;drifted
away of their own selves&rsquo;&mdash;they having no hand in it,
except first cutting them loose, and afterwards plundering
them&mdash;innocents, meaning no harm, who had the misfortune to
observe those foundlings wandering about the Thames.</p>
<p>We were now going in and out, with little noise and great
nicety, among the tiers of shipping, whose many hulls, lying
close together, rose out of the water like black streets.&nbsp;
Here and there, a Scotch, an Irish, or a foreign steamer, getting
up her steam as the tide made, looked, with her great chimney and
high sides, like a quiet factory among the common
buildings.&nbsp; Now, the streets opened into clearer spaces, now
contracted into alleys; but the tiers were so like houses, in the
dark, that I could almost have believed myself in the narrower
bye-ways of Venice.&nbsp; Everything was wonderfully still; for,
it wanted full three hours of flood, and nothing seemed awake but
a dog here and there.</p>
<p>So we took no Tier-rangers captive, nor any Lumpers, nor
Truckers, nor Dredgermen, nor other evil-disposed person or
persons; but went ashore at Wapping, where the old Thames Police
office is now a station-house, and where the old Court, with its
cabin windows looking on the river, is a quaint charge room: with
nothing worse in it usually than a stuffed cat in a glass case,
and a portrait, pleasant to behold, of a rare old Thames Police
officer, Mr. Superintendent Evans, now succeeded by his
son.&nbsp; We looked over the charge books, admirably kept, and
found the prevention so good that there were not five hundred
entries (including drunken and disorderly) in a whole year.&nbsp;
Then, we looked into the store-room; where there was an oakum
smell, and a nautical seasoning of dreadnought clothing, rope
yarn, boat-hooks, sculls and oars, spare stretchers, rudders,
pistols, cutlasses, and the like.&nbsp; Then, into the cell,
aired high up in the wooden wall through an opening like a
kitchen plate-rack: wherein there was a drunken man, not at all
warm, and very wishful to know if it were morning yet.&nbsp;
Then, into a better sort of watch and ward room, where there was
a squadron of stone bottles drawn up, ready to be filled with hot
water and applied to any unfortunate creature who might be
brought in apparently drowned.&nbsp; Finally, we shook hands with
our worthy friend Pea, and ran all the way to Tower Hill, under
strong Police suspicion occasionally, before we got warm.</p>
<h2><a name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 451</span>A
WALK IN A WORKHOUSE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a certain Sunday, I formed one
of the congregation assembled in the chapel of a large
metropolitan Workhouse.&nbsp; With the exception of the clergyman
and clerk, and a very few officials, there were none but paupers
present.&nbsp; The children sat in the galleries; the women in
the body of the chapel, and in one of the side aisles; the men in
the remaining aisle.&nbsp; The service was decorously performed,
though the sermon might have been much better adapted to the
comprehension and to the circumstances of the hearers.&nbsp; The
usual supplications were offered, with more than the usual
significancy in such a place, for the fatherless children and
widows, for all sick persons and young children, for all that
were desolate and oppressed, for the comforting and helping of
the weak-hearted, for the raising-up of them that had fallen; for
all that were in danger, necessity, and tribulation.&nbsp; The
prayers of the congregation were desired &lsquo;for several
persons in the various wards dangerously ill;&rsquo; and others
who were recovering returned their thanks to Heaven.</p>
<p>Among this congregation, were some evil-looking young women,
and beetle-browed young men; but not many&mdash;perhaps that kind
of characters kept away.&nbsp; Generally, the faces (those of the
children excepted) were depressed and subdued, and wanted
colour.&nbsp; Aged people were there, in every variety.&nbsp;
Mumbling, blear-eyed, spectacled, stupid, deaf, lame; vacantly
winking in the gleams of sun that now and then crept in through
the open doors, from the paved yard; shading their listening
ears, or blinking eyes, with their withered hands; poring over
their books, leering at nothing, going to sleep, crouching and
drooping in corners.&nbsp; There were weird old women, all
skeleton within, all bonnet and cloak without, continually wiping
their eyes with dirty dusters of pocket-handkerchiefs; and there
were ugly old crones, both male and female, with a ghastly kind
of contentment upon them which was not at all comforting to
see.&nbsp; Upon the whole, it was the dragon, Pauperism, in a
very weak and impotent condition; toothless, fangless, drawing
his breath heavily enough, and hardly worth chaining up.</p>
<p>When the service was over, I walked with the humane and
conscientious gentleman whose duty it was to take that walk, that
Sunday morning, through the little world of poverty enclosed
within the workhouse walls.&nbsp; It was inhabited by a
population of some fifteen hundred or two thousand paupers,
ranging from the infant newly born or not yet come into the
pauper world, to the old man dying on his bed.</p>
<p>In a room opening from a squalid yard, where a number of
listless women were lounging to and fro, trying to get warm in
the ineffectual sunshine of the tardy May morning&mdash;in the
&lsquo;Itch Ward,&rsquo; not to compromise the truth&mdash;a
woman such as <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> has often drawn,
was hurriedly getting on her gown before a dusty fire.&nbsp; She
was the nurse, or wardswoman, of that insalubrious
department&mdash;herself a pauper&mdash;flabby, raw-boned,
untidy&mdash;unpromising and coarse of aspect as need be.&nbsp;
But, on being spoken to about the patients whom she had in
charge, she turned round, with her shabby gown half on, half off,
and fell a crying with all her might.&nbsp; Not for show, not
querulously, not in any mawkish sentiment, but in the deep grief
and affliction of her heart; turning away her dishevelled head:
sobbing most bitterly, wringing her hands, and letting fall
abundance of great tears, that choked her utterance.&nbsp; What
was the matter with the nurse of the itch-ward?&nbsp; Oh,
&lsquo;the dropped child&rsquo; was dead!&nbsp; Oh, the child
that was found in the street, and she had brought up ever since,
had died an hour ago, and see where the little creature lay,
beneath this cloth!&nbsp; The dear, the pretty dear!</p>
<p>The dropped child seemed too small and poor a thing for Death
to be in earnest with, but Death had taken it; and already its
diminutive form was neatly washed, composed, and stretched as if
in sleep upon a box.&nbsp; I thought I heard a voice from Heaven
saying, It shall be well for thee, O nurse of the itch-ward, when
some less gentle pauper does those offices to thy cold form, that
such as the dropped child are the angels who behold my
Father&rsquo;s face!</p>
<p>In another room, were several ugly old women crouching,
witch-like, round a hearth, and chattering and nodding, after the
manner of the monkeys.&nbsp; &lsquo;All well here?&nbsp; And
enough to eat?&rsquo;&nbsp; A general chattering and chuckling;
at last an answer from a volunteer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh yes,
gentleman!&nbsp; Bless you, gentleman!&nbsp; Lord bless the
Parish of St. So-and-So!&nbsp; It feed the hungry, sir, and give
drink to the thusty, and it warm them which is cold, so it do,
and good luck to the parish of St. So-and-So, and thankee,
gentleman!&rsquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere, a party of pauper nurses were
at dinner.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you get on?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh
pretty well, sir!&nbsp; We works hard, and we lives
hard&mdash;like the sodgers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In another room, a kind of purgatory or place of transition,
six or eight noisy madwomen were gathered together, under the
superintendence of one sane attendant.&nbsp; Among them was a
girl of two or three and twenty, very prettily dressed, of most
respectable appearance and good manners, who had been brought in
from the house where she had lived as domestic servant (having, I
suppose, no friends), on account of being subject to epileptic
fits, and requiring to be removed under the influence of a very
bad one.&nbsp; She was by no means of the same stuff, or the same
breeding, or the same experience, or in the same state of mind,
as those by whom she was surrounded; and she pathetically
complained that the daily association and the nightly noise made
her worse, and was driving her mad&mdash;which was perfectly
evident.&nbsp; The case was noted for inquiry and redress, but
she said she had already been there for some weeks.</p>
<p>If this girl had stolen her mistress&rsquo;s watch, I do not
hesitate to say she would have been infinitely better off.&nbsp;
We have come to this absurd, this dangerous, this monstrous pass,
that the dishonest felon is, in respect of cleanliness, order,
diet, and accommodation, better provided for, and taken care of,
than the honest pauper.</p>
<p>And this conveys no special imputation on the workhouse of the
parish of St. So-and-So, where, on the contrary, I saw many
things to commend.&nbsp; It was very agreeable, recollecting that
most infamous and atrocious enormity committed at
Tooting&mdash;an enormity which, a hundred years hence, will
still be vividly remembered in the bye-ways of English life, and
which has done more to engender a gloomy discontent and suspicion
among many thousands of the people than all the Chartist leaders
could have done in all their lives&mdash;to find the pauper
children in this workhouse looking robust and well, and
apparently the objects of very great care.&nbsp; In the Infant
School&mdash;a large, light, airy room at the top of the
building&mdash;the little creatures, being at dinner, and eating
their potatoes heartily, were not cowed by the presence of
strange visitors, but stretched out their small hands to be
shaken, with a very pleasant confidence.&nbsp; And it was
comfortable to see two mangy pauper rocking-horses rampant in a
corner.&nbsp; In the girls&rsquo; school, where the dinner was
also in progress, everything bore a cheerful and healthy
aspect.&nbsp; The meal was over, in the boys&rsquo; school, by
the time of our arrival there, and the room was not yet quite
rearranged; but the boys were roaming unrestrained about a large
and airy yard, as any other schoolboys might have done.&nbsp;
Some of them had been drawing large ships upon the schoolroom
wall; and if they had a mast with shrouds and stays set up for
practice (as they have in the Middlesex House of Correction), it
would be so much the better.&nbsp; At present, if a boy should
feel a strong impulse upon him to learn the art of going aloft,
he could only gratify it, I presume, as the men and women paupers
gratify their aspirations after better board and lodging, by
smashing as many workhouse windows as possible, and being
promoted to prison.</p>
<p>In one place, the Newgate of the Workhouse, a company of boys
and youths were locked up in a yard alone; their day-room being a
kind of kennel where the casual poor used formerly to be littered
down at night.&nbsp; Divers of them had been there some long
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are they never going away?&rsquo; was the
natural inquiry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Most of them are crippled, in some
form or other,&rsquo; said the Wardsman, &lsquo;and not fit for
anything.&rsquo;&nbsp; They slunk about, like dispirited wolves
or hy&aelig;nas; and made a pounce at their food when it was
served out, much as those animals do.&nbsp; The big-headed idiot
shuffling his feet along the pavement, in the sunlight outside,
was a more agreeable object everyway.</p>
<p>Groves of babies in arms; groves of mothers and other sick
women in bed; groves of lunatics; jungles of men in stone-paved
down-stairs day-rooms, waiting for their dinners; longer and
longer groves of old people, in up-stairs Infirmary wards,
wearing out life, God knows how&mdash;this was the scenery
through which the walk lay, for two hours.&nbsp; In some of these
latter chambers, there were pictures stuck against the wall, and
a neat display of crockery and pewter on a kind of sideboard; now
and then it was a treat to see a plant or two; in almost every
ward there was a cat.</p>
<p>In all of these Long Walks of aged and infirm, some old people
were bedridden, and had been for a long time; some were sitting
on their beds half-naked; some dying in their beds; some out of
bed, and sitting at a table near the fire.&nbsp; A sullen or
lethargic indifference to what was asked, a blunted sensibility
to everything but warmth and food, a moody absence of complaint
as being of no use, a dogged silence and resentful desire to be
left alone again, I thought were generally apparent.&nbsp; On our
walking into the midst of one of these dreary perspectives of old
men, nearly the following little dialogue took place, the nurse
not being immediately at hand:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All well here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer.&nbsp; An old man in a Scotch cap sitting among
others on a form at the table, eating out of a tin porringer,
pushes back his cap a little to look at us, claps it down on his
forehead again with the palm of his hand, and goes on eating.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All well here?&rsquo; (repeated).</p>
<p>No answer.&nbsp; Another old man sitting on his bed,
paralytically peeling a boiled potato, lifts his head and
stares.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enough to eat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer.&nbsp; Another old man, in bed, turns himself and
coughs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you to-day?&rsquo;&nbsp; To the last old
man.</p>
<p>That old man says nothing; but another old man, a tall old man
of very good address, speaking with perfect correctness, comes
forward from somewhere, and volunteers an answer.&nbsp; The reply
almost always proceeds from a volunteer, and not from the person
looked at or spoken to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are very old, sir,&rsquo; in a mild, distinct
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t expect to be well, most of
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you comfortable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no complaint to make, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; With a
half shake of his head, a half shrug of his shoulders, and a kind
of apologetic smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enough to eat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir, I have but a poor appetite,&rsquo; with the
same air as before; &lsquo;and yet I get through my allowance
very easily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; showing a porringer with a Sunday dinner in
it; &lsquo;here is a portion of mutton, and three potatoes.&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t starve on that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear no, sir,&rsquo; with the same apologetic
air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not starve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have very little bread, sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an
exceedingly small quantity of bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The nurse, who is now rubbing her hands at the
questioner&rsquo;s elbow, interferes with, &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t
much raly, sir.&nbsp; You see they&rsquo;ve only six ounces a
day, and when they&rsquo;ve took their breakfast, there can only
be a little left for night, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another old man, hitherto invisible, rises out of his
bed-clothes, as out of a grave, and looks on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have tea at night?&rsquo;&nbsp; The questioner is
still addressing the well-spoken old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, we have tea at night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you save what bread you can from the morning, to
eat with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir&mdash;if we can save any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you want more to eat with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; With a very anxious face.</p>
<p>The questioner, in the kindness of his heart, appears a little
discomposed, and changes the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has become of the old man who used to lie in that
bed in the corner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The nurse don&rsquo;t remember what old man is referred
to.&nbsp; There has been such a many old men.&nbsp; The
well-spoken old man is doubtful.&nbsp; The spectral old man who
has come to life in bed, says, &lsquo;Billy Stevens.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Another old man who has previously had his head in the fireplace,
pipes out,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charley Walters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Something like a feeble interest is awakened.&nbsp; I suppose
Charley Walters had conversation in him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; says the piping old man.</p>
<p>Another old man, with one eye screwed up, hastily displaces
the piping old man, and says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; Charley Walters died in that bed,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Billy Stevens,&rsquo; persists the spectral old
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! and Johnny Rogers died in that bed,
and&mdash;and&mdash;they&rsquo;re both on &rsquo;em
dead&mdash;and Sam&rsquo;l Bowyer;&rsquo; this seems very
extraordinary to him; &lsquo;he went out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this he subsides, and all the old men (having had quite
enough of it) subside, and the spectral old man goes into his
grave again, and takes the shade of Billy Stevens with him.</p>
<p>As we turn to go out at the door, another previously invisible
old man, a hoarse old man in a flannel gown, is standing there,
as if he had just come up through the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir, could I take the liberty of
saying a word?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am greatly better in my health, sir; but what I want,
to get me quite round,&rsquo; with his hand on his throat,
&lsquo;is a little fresh air, sir.&nbsp; It has always done my
complaint so much good, sir.&nbsp; The regular leave for going
out, comes round so seldom, that if the gentlemen, next Friday,
would give me leave to go out walking, now and then&mdash;for
only an hour or so, sir!&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Who could wonder, looking through those weary vistas of bed
and infirmity, that it should do him good to meet with some other
scenes, and assure himself that there was something else on
earth?&nbsp; Who could help wondering why the old men lived on as
they did; what grasp they had on life; what crumbs of interest or
occupation they could pick up from its bare board; whether
Charley Walters had ever described to them the days when he kept
company with some old pauper woman in the bud, or Billy Stevens
ever told them of the time when he was a dweller in the far-off
foreign land called Home!</p>
<p>The morsel of burnt child, lying in another room, so
patiently, in bed, wrapped in lint, and looking steadfastly at us
with his bright quiet eyes when we spoke to him kindly, looked as
if the knowledge of these things, and of all the tender things
there are to think about, might have been in his mind&mdash;as if
he thought, with us, that there was a fellow-feeling in the
pauper nurses which appeared to make them more kind to their
charges than the race of common nurses in the hospitals&mdash;as
if he mused upon the Future of some older children lying around
him in the same place, and thought it best, perhaps, all things
considered, that he should die&mdash;as if he knew, without fear,
of those many coffins, made and unmade, piled up in the store
below&mdash;and of his unknown friend, &lsquo;the dropped
child,&rsquo; calm upon the box-lid covered with a cloth.&nbsp;
But there was something wistful and appealing, too, in his tiny
face, as if, in the midst of all the hard necessities and
incongruities he pondered on, he pleaded, in behalf of the
helpless and the aged poor, for a little more liberty&mdash;and a
little more bread.</p>

457</span>PRINCE BULL.&nbsp; A FAIRY TALE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, and of course it
was in the Golden Age, and I hope you may know when that was, for
I am sure I don&rsquo;t, though I have tried hard to find out,
there lived in a rich and fertile country, a powerful Prince
whose name was <span class="smcap">Bull</span>.&nbsp; He had gone
through a great deal of fighting, in his time, about all sorts of
things, including nothing; but, had gradually settled down to be
a steady, peaceable, good-natured, corpulent, rather sleepy
Prince.</p>
<p>This Puissant Prince was married to a lovely Princess whose
name was Fair Freedom.&nbsp; She had brought him a large fortune,
and had borne him an immense number of children, and had set them
to spinning, and farming, and engineering, and soldiering, and
sailoring, and doctoring, and lawyering, and preaching, and all
kinds of trades.&nbsp; The coffers of Prince Bull were full of
treasure, his cellars were crammed with delicious wines from all
parts of the world, the richest gold and silver plate that ever
was seen adorned his sideboards, his sons were strong, his
daughters were handsome, and in short you might have supposed
that if there ever lived upon earth a fortunate and happy Prince,
the name of that Prince, take him for all in all, was assuredly
Prince Bull.</p>
<p>But, appearances, as we all know, are not always to be
trusted&mdash;far from it; and if they had led you to this
conclusion respecting Prince Bull, they would have led you wrong
as they often have led me.</p>
<p>For, this good Prince had two sharp thorns in his pillow, two
hard knobs in his crown, two heavy loads on his mind, two
unbridled nightmares in his sleep, two rocks ahead in his
course.&nbsp; He could not by any means get servants to suit him,
and he had a tyrannical old godmother, whose name was Tape.</p>
<p>She was a Fairy, this Tape, and was a bright red all
over.&nbsp; She was disgustingly prim and formal, and could never
bend herself a hair&rsquo;s breadth this way or that way, out of
her naturally crooked shape.&nbsp; But, she was very potent in
her wicked art.&nbsp; She could stop the fastest thing in the
world, change the strongest thing into the weakest, and the most
useful into the most useless.&nbsp; To do this she had only to
put her cold hand upon it, and repeat her own name, Tape.&nbsp;
Then it withered away.</p>
<p>At the Court of Prince Bull&mdash;at least I don&rsquo;t mean
literally at his court, because he was a very genteel Prince, and
readily yielded to his godmother when she always reserved that
for his hereditary Lords and Ladies&mdash;in the dominions of
Prince Bull, among the great mass of the community who were
called in the language of that polite country the Mobs and the
Snobs, were a number of very ingenious men, who were always busy
with some invention or other, for promoting the prosperity of the
Prince&rsquo;s subjects, and augmenting the Prince&rsquo;s
power.&nbsp; But, whenever they submitted their models for the
Prince&rsquo;s approval, his godmother stepped forward, laid her
hand upon them, and said &lsquo;Tape.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hence it came
to pass, that when any particularly good discovery was made, the
discoverer usually carried it off to some other Prince, in
foreign parts, who had no old godmother who said Tape.&nbsp; This
was not on the whole an advantageous state of things for Prince
Bull, to the best of my understanding.</p>
<p>The worst of it was, that Prince Bull had in course of years
lapsed into such a state of subjection to this unlucky godmother,
that he never made any serious effort to rid himself of her
tyranny.&nbsp; I have said this was the worst of it, but there I
was wrong, because there is a worse consequence still,
behind.&nbsp; The Prince&rsquo;s numerous family became so
downright sick and tired of Tape, that when they should have
helped the Prince out of the difficulties into which that evil
creature led him, they fell into a dangerous habit of moodily
keeping away from him in an impassive and indifferent manner, as
though they had quite forgotten that no harm could happen to the
Prince their father, without its inevitably affecting
themselves.</p>
<p>Such was the aspect of affairs at the court of Prince Bull,
when this great Prince found it necessary to go to war with
Prince Bear.&nbsp; He had been for some time very doubtful of his
servants, who, besides being indolent and addicted to enriching
their families at his expense, domineered over him dreadfully;
threatening to discharge themselves if they were found the least
fault with, pretending that they had done a wonderful amount of
work when they had done nothing, making the most unmeaning
speeches that ever were heard in the Prince&rsquo;s name, and
uniformly showing themselves to be very inefficient indeed.&nbsp;
Though, that some of them had excellent characters from previous
situations is not to be denied.&nbsp; Well; Prince Bull called
his servants together, and said to them one and all, &lsquo;Send
out my army against Prince Bear.&nbsp; Clothe it, arm it, feed
it, provide it with all necessaries and contingencies, and I will
pay the piper!&nbsp; Do your duty by my brave troops,&rsquo; said
the Prince, &lsquo;and do it well, and I will pour my treasure
out like water, to defray the cost.&nbsp; Who ever heard <span
class="GutSmall">ME</span> complain of money well laid
out!&rsquo;&nbsp; Which indeed he had reason for saying, inasmuch
as he was well known to be a truly generous and munificent
Prince.</p>
<p>When the servants heard those words, they sent out the army
against Prince Bear, and they set the army tailors to work, and
the army provision merchants, and the makers of guns both great
and small, and the gunpowder makers, and the makers of ball,
shell, and shot; and they bought up all manner of stores and
ships, without troubling their heads about the price, and
appeared to be so busy that the good Prince rubbed his hands, and
(using a favourite expression of his), said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
all right!&rsquo;&nbsp; But, while they were thus employed, the
Prince&rsquo;s godmother, who was a great favourite with those
servants, looked in upon them continually all day long, and
whenever she popped in her head at the door said, How do you do,
my children?&nbsp; What are you doing here?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Official business, godmother.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; says this wicked Fairy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&mdash;Tape!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the business all went
wrong, whatever it was, and the servants&rsquo; heads became so
addled and muddled that they thought they were doing wonders.</p>
<p>Now, this was very bad conduct on the part of the vicious old
nuisance, and she ought to have been strangled, even if she had
stopped here; but, she didn&rsquo;t stop here, as you shall
learn.&nbsp; For, a number of the Prince&rsquo;s subjects, being
very fond of the Prince&rsquo;s army who were the bravest of men,
assembled together and provided all manner of eatables and
drinkables, and books to read, and clothes to wear, and tobacco
to smoke, and candies to burn, and nailed them up in great
packing-cases, and put them aboard a great many ships, to be
carried out to that brave army in the cold and inclement country
where they were fighting Prince Bear.&nbsp; Then, up comes this
wicked Fairy as the ships were weighing anchor, and says,
&lsquo;How do you do, my children?&nbsp; What are you doing
here?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;We are going with all these comforts to
the army, godmother.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; says
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;A pleasant voyage, my
darlings.&mdash;Tape!&rsquo;&nbsp; And from that time forth,
those enchanting ships went sailing, against wind and tide and
rhyme and reason, round and round the world, and whenever they
touched at any port were ordered off immediately, and could never
deliver their cargoes anywhere.</p>
<p>This, again, was very bad conduct on the part of the vicious
old nuisance, and she ought to have been strangled for it if she
had done nothing worse; but, she did something worse still, as
you shall learn.&nbsp; For, she got astride of an official
broomstick, and muttered as a spell these two sentences,
&lsquo;On Her Majesty&rsquo;s service,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I have
the honour to be, sir, your most obedient servant,&rsquo; and
presently alighted in the cold and inclement country where the
army of Prince Bull were encamped to fight the army of Prince
Bear.&nbsp; On the sea-shore of that country, she found piled
together, a number of houses for the army to live in, and a
quantity of provisions for the army to live upon, and a quantity
of clothes for the army to wear: while, sitting in the mud gazing
at them, were a group of officers as red to look at as the wicked
old woman herself.&nbsp; So, she said to one of them, &lsquo;Who
are <i>you</i>, my darling, and how do <i>you</i>
do?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am the Quartermaster General&rsquo;s
Department, godmother, and <i>I</i> am pretty well.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then she said to another, &lsquo;Who are you, my darling, and how
do you do?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am the Commissariat Department,
godmother, and I am pretty well!&nbsp; Then she said to another,
&lsquo;Who are you, my darling, and how do you
do?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am the Head of the Medical Department,
godmother, and <i>I</i> am pretty well.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, she
said to some gentlemen scented with lavender, who kept themselves
at a great distance from the rest, &lsquo;And who are <i>you</i>,
my pretty pets, and how do <i>you</i> do?&rsquo;&nbsp; And they
answered, &lsquo;We-aw-are-the-aw-Staff-aw-Department, godmother,
and we are very well indeed.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am delighted
to see you all, my beauties,&rsquo; says this wicked old Fairy,
&lsquo;&mdash;Tape!&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon that, the houses, clothes,
and provisions, all mouldered away; and the soldiers who were
sound, fell sick; and the soldiers who were sick, died miserably:
and the noble army of Prince Bull perished.</p>
<p>When the dismal news of his great loss was carried to the
Prince, he suspected his godmother very much indeed; but, he knew
that his servants must have kept company with the malicious
beldame, and must have given way to her, and therefore he
resolved to turn those servants out of their places.&nbsp; So, he
called to him a Roebuck who had the gift of speech, and he said,
&lsquo;Good Roebuck, tell them they must go.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, the
good Roebuck delivered his message, so like a man that you might
have supposed him to be nothing but a man, and they were turned
out&mdash;but, not without warning, for that they had had a long
time.</p>
<p>And now comes the most extraordinary part of the history of
this Prince.&nbsp; When he had turned out those servants, of
course he wanted others.&nbsp; What was his astonishment to find
that in all his dominions, which contained no less than
twenty-seven millions of people, there were not above
five-and-twenty servants altogether!&nbsp; They were so lofty
about it, too, that instead of discussing whether they should
hire themselves as servants to Prince Bull, they turned things
topsy-turvy, and considered whether as a favour they should hire
Prince Bull to be their master!&nbsp; While they were arguing
this point among themselves quite at their leisure, the wicked
old red Fairy was incessantly going up and down, knocking at the
doors of twelve of the oldest of the five-and-twenty, who were
the oldest inhabitants in all that country, and whose united ages
amounted to one thousand, saying, &lsquo;Will you hire Prince
Bull for your master?&mdash;Will you hire Prince Bull for your
master?&rsquo;&nbsp; To which one answered, &lsquo;I will if next
door will;&rsquo; and another, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t if over the
way does;&rsquo; and another, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t if he, she, or
they, might, could, would, or should.&rsquo;&nbsp; And all this
time Prince Bull&rsquo;s affairs were going to rack and ruin.</p>
<p>At last, Prince Bull in the height of his perplexity assumed a
thoughtful face, as if he were struck by an entirely new
idea.&nbsp; The wicked old Fairy, seeing this, was at his elbow
directly, and said, &lsquo;How do you do, my Prince, and what are
you thinking of?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am thinking,
godmother,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that among all the
seven-and-twenty millions of my subjects who have never been in
service, there are men of intellect and business who have made me
very famous both among my friends and
enemies.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Aye, truly?&rsquo; says the
Fairy.&mdash;&lsquo;Aye, truly,&rsquo; says the
Prince.&mdash;&lsquo;And what then?&rsquo; says the
Fairy.&mdash;&lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;since the
regular old class of servants do so ill, are so hard to get, and
carry it with so high a hand, perhaps I might try to make good
servants of some of these.&rsquo;&nbsp; The words had no sooner
passed his lips than she returned, chuckling, &lsquo;You think
so, do you?&nbsp; Indeed, my Prince?&mdash;Tape!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon he directly forgot what he was thinking of, and cried
out lamentably to the old servants, &lsquo;O, do come and hire
your poor old master!&nbsp; Pray do!&nbsp; On any
terms!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And this, for the present, finishes the story of Prince
Bull.&nbsp; I wish I could wind it up by saying that he lived
happy ever afterwards, but I cannot in my conscience do so; for,
with Tape at his elbow, and his estranged children fatally
repelled by her from coming near him, I do not, to tell you the
plain truth, believe in the possibility of such an end to it.</p>
<h2><a name="page462"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 462</span>A
PLATED ARTICLE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Putting</span> up for the night in one of
the chiefest towns of Staffordshire, I find it to be by no means
a lively town.&nbsp; In fact, it is as dull and dead a town as
any one could desire not to see.&nbsp; It seems as if its whole
population might be imprisoned in its Railway Station.&nbsp; The
Refreshment Room at that Station is a vortex of dissipation
compared with the extinct town-inn, the Dodo, in the dull High
Street.</p>
<p>Why High Street?&nbsp; Why not rather Low Street, Flat Street,
Low-Spirited Street, Used-up Street?&nbsp; Where are the people
who belong to the High Street?&nbsp; Can they all be dispersed
over the face of the country, seeking the unfortunate Strolling
Manager who decamped from the mouldy little Theatre last week, in
the beginning of his season (as his play-bills testify),
repentantly resolved to bring him back, and feed him, and be
entertained?&nbsp; Or, can they all be gathered to their fathers
in the two old churchyards near to the High
Street&mdash;retirement into which churchyards appears to be a
mere ceremony, there is so very little life outside their
confines, and such small discernible difference between being
buried alive in the town, and buried dead in the town
tombs?&nbsp; Over the way, opposite to the staring blank bow
windows of the Dodo, are a little ironmonger&rsquo;s shop, a
little tailor&rsquo;s shop (with a picture of the Fashions in the
small window and a bandy-legged baby on the pavement staring at
it)&mdash;a watchmakers shop, where all the clocks and watches
must be stopped, I am sure, for they could never have the courage
to go, with the town in general, and the Dodo in particular,
looking at them.&nbsp; Shade of Miss Linwood, erst of Leicester
Square, London, thou art welcome here, and thy retreat is fitly
chosen!&nbsp; I myself was one of the last visitors to that awful
storehouse of thy life&rsquo;s work, where an anchorite old man
and woman took my shilling with a solemn wonder, and conducting
me to a gloomy sepulchre of needlework dropping to pieces with
dust and age and shrouded in twilight at high noon, left me
there, chilled, frightened, and alone.&nbsp; And now, in ghostly
letters on all the dead walls of this dead town, I read thy
honoured name, and find that thy Last Supper, worked in Berlin
Wool, invites inspection as a powerful excitement!</p>
<p>Where are the people who are bidden with so much cry to this
feast of little wool?&nbsp; Where are they?&nbsp; Who are
they?&nbsp; They are not the bandy-legged baby studying the
fashions in the tailor&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; They are not the two
earthy ploughmen lounging outside the saddler&rsquo;s shop, in
the stiff square where the Town Hall stands, like a brick and
mortar private on parade.&nbsp; They are not the landlady of the
Dodo in the empty bar, whose eye had trouble in it and no
welcome, when I asked for dinner.&nbsp; They are not the turnkeys
of the Town Jail, looking out of the gateway in their uniforms,
as if they had locked up all the balance (as my American friends
would say) of the inhabitants, and could now rest a little.&nbsp;
They are not the two dusty millers in the white mill down by the
river, where the great water-wheel goes heavily round and round,
like the monotonous days and nights in this forgotten
place.&nbsp; Then who are they, for there is no one else?&nbsp;
No; this deponent maketh oath and saith that there is no one
else, save and except the waiter at the Dodo, now laying the
cloth.&nbsp; I have paced the streets, and stared at the houses,
and am come back to the blank bow window of the Dodo; and the
town clocks strike seven, and the reluctant echoes seem to cry,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wake us!&rsquo; and the bandy-legged baby has
gone home to bed.</p>
<p>If the Dodo were only a gregarious bird&mdash;if he had only
some confused idea of making a comfortable nest&mdash;I could
hope to get through the hours between this and bed-time, without
being consumed by devouring melancholy.&nbsp; But, the
Dodo&rsquo;s habits are all wrong.&nbsp; It provides me with a
trackless desert of sitting-room, with a chair for every day in
the year, a table for every month, and a waste of sideboard where
a lonely China vase pines in a corner for its mate long departed,
and will never make a match with the candlestick in the opposite
corner if it live till Doomsday.&nbsp; The Dodo has nothing in
the larder.&nbsp; Even now, I behold the Boots returning with my
sole in a piece of paper; and with that portion of my dinner, the
Boots, perceiving me at the blank bow window, slaps his leg as he
comes across the road, pretending it is something else.&nbsp; The
Dodo excludes the outer air.&nbsp; When I mount up to my bedroom,
a smell of closeness and flue gets lazily up my nose like sleepy
snuff.&nbsp; The loose little bits of carpet writhe under my
tread, and take wormy shapes.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know the
ridiculous man in the looking-glass, beyond having met him once
or twice in a dish-cover&mdash;and I can never shave <i>him</i>
to-morrow morning!&nbsp; The Dodo is narrow-minded as to towels;
expects me to wash on a freemason&rsquo;s apron without the
trimming: when I asked for soap, gives me a stony-hearted
something white, with no more lather in it than the Elgin
marbles.&nbsp; The Dodo has seen better days, and possesses
interminable stables at the back&mdash;silent, grass-grown,
broken-windowed, horseless.</p>
<p>This mournful bird can fry a sole, however, which is
much.&nbsp; Can cook a steak, too, which is more.&nbsp; I wonder
where it gets its Sherry?&nbsp; If I were to send my pint of wine
to some famous chemist to be analysed, what would it turn out to
be made of?&nbsp; It tastes of pepper, sugar, bitter-almonds,
vinegar, warm knives, any flat drinks, and a little brandy.&nbsp;
Would it unman a Spanish exile by reminding him of his native
land at all?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; If there really be any
townspeople out of the churchyards, and if a caravan of them ever
do dine, with a bottle of wine per man, in this desert of the
Dodo, it must make good for the doctor next day!</p>
<p>Where was the waiter born?&nbsp; How did he come here?&nbsp;
Has he any hope of getting away from here?&nbsp; Does he ever
receive a letter, or take a ride upon the railway, or see
anything but the Dodo?&nbsp; Perhaps he has seen the Berlin
Wool.&nbsp; He appears to have a silent sorrow on him, and it may
be that.&nbsp; He clears the table; draws the dingy curtains of
the great bow window, which so unwillingly consent to meet, that
they must be pinned together; leaves me by the fire with my pint
decanter, and a little thin funnel-shaped wine-glass, and a plate
of pale biscuits&mdash;in themselves engendering desperation.</p>
<p>No book, no newspaper!&nbsp; I left the Arabian Nights in the
railway carriage, and have nothing to read but Bradshaw, and
&lsquo;that way madness lies.&rsquo;&nbsp; Remembering what
prisoners and ship-wrecked mariners have done to exercise their
minds in solitude, I repeat the multiplication table, the pence
table, and the shilling table: which are all the tables I happen
to know.&nbsp; What if I write something?&nbsp; The Dodo keeps no
pens but steel pens; and those I always stick through the paper,
and can turn to no other account.</p>
<p>What am I to do?&nbsp; Even if I could have the bandy-legged
baby knocked up and brought here, I could offer him nothing but
sherry, and that would be the death of him.&nbsp; He would never
hold up his head again if he touched it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t go
to bed, because I have conceived a mortal hatred for my bedroom;
and I can&rsquo;t go away, because there is no train for my place
of destination until morning.&nbsp; To burn the biscuits will be
but a fleeting joy; still it is a temporary relief, and here they
go on the fire!&nbsp; Shall I break the plate?&nbsp; First let me
look at the back, and see who made it.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Copeland</span>.</p>
<p>Copeland!&nbsp; Stop a moment.&nbsp; Was it yesterday I
visited Copeland&rsquo;s works, and saw them making plates?&nbsp;
In the confusion of travelling about, it might be yesterday or it
might be yesterday month; but I think it was yesterday.&nbsp; I
appeal to the plate.&nbsp; The plate says, decidedly,
yesterday.&nbsp; I find the plate, as I look at it, growing into
a companion.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you remember (says the plate) how you steamed
away, yesterday morning, in the bright sun and the east wind,
along the valley of the sparkling Trent?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
recollect how many kilns you flew past, looking like the bowls of
gigantic tobacco-pipes, cut short off from the stem and turned
upside down?&nbsp; And the fires&mdash;and the smoke&mdash;and
the roads made with bits of crockery, as if all the plates and
dishes in the civilised world had been Macadamised, expressly for
the laming of all the horses?&nbsp; Of course I do!</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you remember (says the plate) how you alighted
at Stoke&mdash;a picturesque heap of houses, kilns, smoke,
wharfs, canals, and river, lying (as was most appropriate) in a
basin&mdash;and how, after climbing up the sides of the basin to
look at the prospect, you trundled down again at a walking-match
pace, and straight proceeded to my father&rsquo;s,
Copeland&rsquo;s, where the whole of my family, high and low,
rich and poor, are turned out upon the world from our nursery and
seminary, covering some fourteen acres of ground?&nbsp; And
don&rsquo;t you remember what we spring from:&mdash;heaps of
lumps of clay, partially prepared and cleaned in Devonshire and
Dorsetshire, whence said clay principally comes&mdash;and hills
of flint, without which we should want our ringing sound, and
should never be musical?&nbsp; And as to the flint, don&rsquo;t
you recollect that it is first burnt in kilns, and is then laid
under the four iron feet of a demon slave, subject to violent
stamping fits, who, when they come on, stamps away insanely with
his four iron legs, and would crush all the flint in the Isle of
Thanet to powder, without leaving off?&nbsp; And as to the clay,
don&rsquo;t you recollect how it is put into mills or teazers,
and is sliced, and dug, and cut at, by endless knives, clogged
and sticky, but persistent&mdash;and is pressed out of that
machine through a square trough, whose form it takes&mdash;and is
cut off in square lumps and thrown into a vat, and there mixed
with water, and beaten to a pulp by paddle-wheels&mdash;and is
then run into a rough house, all rugged beams and ladders
splashed with white,&mdash;superintended by Grindoff the Miller
in his working clothes, all splashed with white,&mdash;where it
passes through no end of machinery-moved sieves all splashed with
white, arranged in an ascending scale of fineness (some so fine,
that three hundred silk threads cross each other in a single
square inch of their surface), and all in a violent state of ague
with their teeth for ever chattering, and their bodies for ever
shivering!&nbsp; And as to the flint again, isn&rsquo;t it mashed
and mollified and troubled and soothed, exactly as rags are in a
paper-mill, until it is reduced to a pap so fine that it contains
no atom of &lsquo;grit&rsquo; perceptible to the nicest
taste?&nbsp; And as to the flint and the clay together, are they
not, after all this, mixed in the proportion of five of clay to
one of flint, and isn&rsquo;t the compound&mdash;known as
&lsquo;slip&rsquo;&mdash;run into oblong troughs, where its
superfluous moisture may evaporate; and finally, isn&rsquo;t it
slapped and banged and beaten and patted and kneaded and wedged
and knocked about like butter, until it becomes a beautiful grey
dough, ready for the potter&rsquo;s use?</p>
<p>In regard of the potter, popularly so called (says the plate),
you don&rsquo;t mean to say you have forgotten that a workman
called a Thrower is the man under whose hand this grey dough
takes the shapes of the simpler household vessels as quickly as
the eye can follow?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean to say you cannot
call him up before you, sitting, with his attendant woman, at his
potter&rsquo;s wheel&mdash;a disc about the size of a
dinner-plate, revolving on two drums slowly or quickly as he
wills&mdash;who made you a complete breakfast-set for a bachelor,
as a good-humoured little off-hand joke?&nbsp; You remember how
he took up as much dough as he wanted, and, throwing it on his
wheel, in a moment fashioned it into a teacup&mdash;caught up
more clay and made a saucer&mdash;a larger dab and whirled it
into a teapot&mdash;winked at a smaller dab and converted it into
the lid of the teapot, accurately fitting by the measurement of
his eye alone&mdash;coaxed a middle-sized dab for two seconds,
broke it, turned it over at the rim, and made a
milkpot&mdash;laughed, and turned out a slop-basin&mdash;coughed,
and provided for the sugar?&nbsp; Neither, I think, are you
oblivious of the newer mode of making various articles, but
especially basins, according to which improvement a mould
revolves instead of a disc?&nbsp; For you must remember (says the
plate) how you saw the mould of a little basin spinning round and
round, and how the workmen smoothed and pressed a handful of
dough upon it, and how with an instrument called a profile (a
piece of wood, representing the profile of a basin&rsquo;s foot)
he cleverly scraped and carved the ring which makes the base of
any such basin, and then took the basin off the lathe like a
doughy skull-cap to be dried, and afterwards (in what is called a
green state) to be put into a second lathe, there to be finished
and burnished with a steel burnisher?&nbsp; And as to moulding in
general (says the plate), it can&rsquo;t be necessary for me to
remind you that all ornamental articles, and indeed all articles
not quite circular, are made in moulds.&nbsp; For you must
remember how you saw the vegetable dishes, for example, being
made in moulds; and how the handles of teacups, and the spouts of
teapots, and the feet of tureens, and so forth, are all made in
little separate moulds, and are each stuck on to the body
corporate, of which it is destined to form a part, with a stuff
called &lsquo;slag,&rsquo; as quickly as you can recollect
it.&nbsp; Further, you learnt&mdash;you know you did&mdash;in the
same visit, how the beautiful sculptures in the delicate new
material called Parian, are all constructed in moulds; how, into
that material, animal bones are ground up, because the phosphate
of lime contained in bones makes it translucent; how everything
is moulded, before going into the fire, one-fourth larger than it
is intended to come out of the fire, because it shrinks in that
proportion in the intense heat; how, when a figure shrinks
unequally, it is spoiled&mdash;emerging from the furnace a
misshapen birth; a big head and a little body, or a little head
and a big body, or a Quasimodo with long arms and short legs, or
a Miss Biffin with neither legs nor arms worth mentioning.</p>
<p>And as to the Kilns, in which the firing takes place, and in
which some of the more precious articles are burnt repeatedly, in
various stages of their process towards completion,&mdash;as to
the Kilns (says the plate, warming with the recollection), if you
don&rsquo;t remember <span class="GutSmall">THEM</span> with a
horrible interest, what did you ever go to Copeland&rsquo;s
for?&nbsp; When you stood inside of one of those inverted bowls
of a Pre-Adamite tobacco-pipe, looking up at the blue sky through
the open top far off, as you might have looked up from a well,
sunk under the centre of the pavement of the Pantheon at Rome,
had you the least idea where you were?&nbsp; And when you found
yourself surrounded, in that dome-shaped cavern, by innumerable
columns of an unearthly order of architecture, supporting
nothing, and squeezed close together as if a Pre-Adamite Samson
had taken a vast Hall in his arms and crushed it into the
smallest possible space, had you the least idea what they
were?&nbsp; No (says the plate), of course not!&nbsp; And when
you found that each of those pillars was a pile of ingeniously
made vessels of coarse clay&mdash;called Saggers&mdash;looking,
when separate, like raised-pies for the table of the mighty Giant
Blunderbore, and now all full of various articles of pottery
ranged in them in baking order, the bottom of each vessel serving
for the cover of the one below, and the whole Kiln rapidly
filling with these, tier upon tier, until the last workman should
have barely room to crawl out, before the closing of the jagged
aperture in the wall and the kindling of the gradual fire; did
you not stand amazed to think that all the year round these dread
chambers are heating, white hot&mdash;and cooling&mdash;and
filling&mdash;and emptying&mdash;and being bricked up&mdash;and
broken open&mdash;humanly speaking, for ever and ever?&nbsp; To
be sure you did!&nbsp; And standing in one of those Kilns nearly
full, and seeing a free crow shoot across the aperture a-top, and
learning how the fire would wax hotter and hotter by slow
degrees, and would cool similarly through a space of from forty
to sixty hours, did no remembrance of the days when human clay
was burnt oppress you?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I think so!&nbsp; I
suspect that some fancy of a fiery haze and a shortening breath,
and a growing heat, and a gasping prayer; and a figure in black
interposing between you and the sky (as figures in black are very
apt to do), and looking down, before it grew too hot to look and
live, upon the Heretic in his edifying agony&mdash;I say I
suspect (says the plate) that some such fancy was pretty strong
upon you when you went out into the air, and blessed God for the
bright spring day and the degenerate times!</p>
<p>After that, I needn&rsquo;t remind you what a relief it was to
see the simplest process of ornamenting this
&lsquo;biscuit&rsquo; (as it is called when baked) with brown
circles and blue trees&mdash;converting it into the common
crockery-ware that is exported to Africa, and used in cottages at
home.&nbsp; For (says the plate) I am well persuaded that you
bear in mind how those particular jugs and mugs were once more
set upon a lathe and put in motion; and how a man blew the brown
colour (having a strong natural affinity with the material in
that condition) on them from a blowpipe as they twirled; and how
his daughter, with a common brush, dropped blotches of blue upon
them in the right places; and how, tilting the blotches upside
down, she made them run into rude images of trees, and there an
end.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t you see (says the plate) planted upon my own
brother that astounding blue willow, with knobbed and gnarled
trunk, and foliage of blue ostrich feathers, which gives our
family the title of &lsquo;willow pattern&rsquo;?&nbsp; And
didn&rsquo;t you observe, transferred upon him at the same time,
that blue bridge which spans nothing, growing out from the roots
of the willow; and the three blue Chinese going over it into a
blue temple, which has a fine crop of blue bushes sprouting out
of the roof; and a blue boat sailing above them, the mast of
which is burglariously sticking itself into the foundations of a
blue villa, suspended sky-high, surmounted by a lump of blue
rock, sky-higher, and a couple of billing blue birds,
sky-highest&mdash;together with the rest of that amusing blue
landscape, which has, in deference to our revered ancestors of
the Cerulean Empire, and in defiance of every known law of
perspective, adorned millions of our family ever since the days
of platters?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you inspect the copper-plate on
which my pattern was deeply engraved?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you
perceive an impression of it taken in cobalt colour at a
cylindrical press, upon a leaf of thin paper, streaming from a
plunge-bath of soap and water?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t the paper
impression daintily spread, by a light-fingered damsel (you know
you admired her!), over the surface of the plate, and the back of
the paper rubbed prodigiously hard&mdash;with a long tight roll
of flannel, tied up like a round of hung beef&mdash;without so
much as ruffling the paper, wet as it was?&nbsp; Then (says the
plate), was not the paper washed away with a sponge, and
didn&rsquo;t there appear, set off upon the plate, <i>this</i>
identical piece of Pre-Raphaelite blue distemper which you now
behold?&nbsp; Not to be denied!&nbsp; I had seen all
this&mdash;and more.&nbsp; I had been shown, at Copeland&rsquo;s,
patterns of beautiful design, in faultless perspective, which are
causing the ugly old willow to wither out of public favour; and
which, being quite as cheap, insinuate good wholesome natural art
into the humblest households.&nbsp; When Mr. and Mrs. Sprat have
satisfied their material tastes by that equal division of fat and
lean which has made their <i>m&eacute;nage</i> immortal; and
have, after the elegant tradition, &lsquo;licked the platter
clean,&rsquo; they can&mdash;thanks to modern artists in
clay&mdash;feast their intellectual tastes upon excellent
delineations of natural objects.</p>
<p>This reflection prompts me to transfer my attention from the
blue plate to the forlorn but cheerfully painted vase on the
sideboard.&nbsp; And surely (says the plate) you have not
forgotten how the outlines of such groups of flowers as you see
there, are printed, just as I was printed, and are afterwards
shaded and filled in with metallic colours by women and
girls?&nbsp; As to the aristocracy of our order, made of the
finer clay-porcelain peers and peeresses;&mdash;the slabs, and
panels, and table-tops, and tazze; the endless nobility and
gentry of dessert, breakfast, and tea services; the gemmed
perfume bottles, and scarlet and gold salvers; you saw that they
were painted by artists, with metallic colours laid on with
camel-hair pencils, and afterwards burnt in.</p>
<p>And talking of burning in (says the plate), didn&rsquo;t you
find that every subject, from the willow pattern to the landscape
after Turner&mdash;having been framed upon clay or porcelain
biscuit&mdash;has to be glazed?&nbsp; Of course, you saw the
glaze&mdash;composed of various vitreous materials&mdash;laid
over every article; and of course you witnessed the close
imprisonment of each piece in saggers upon the separate system
rigidly enforced by means of fine-pointed earthenware stilts
placed between the articles to prevent the slightest
communication or contact.&nbsp; We had in my time&mdash;and I
suppose it is the same now&mdash;fourteen hours&rsquo; firing to
fix the glaze and to make it &lsquo;run&rsquo; all over us
equally, so as to put a good shiny and unscratchable surface upon
us.&nbsp; Doubtless, you observed that one sort of
glaze&mdash;called printing-body&mdash;is burnt into the better
sort of ware <i>before</i> it is printed.&nbsp; Upon this you saw
some of the finest steel engravings transferred, to be fixed by
an after glazing&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Why, of course you
did!</p>
<p>Of course I did.&nbsp; I had seen and enjoyed everything that
the plate recalled to me, and had beheld with admiration how the
rotatory motion which keeps this ball of ours in its place in the
great scheme, with all its busy mites upon it, was necessary
throughout the process, and could only be dispensed with in the
fire.&nbsp; So, listening to the plate&rsquo;s reminders, and
musing upon them, I got through the evening after all, and went
to bed.&nbsp; I made but one sleep of it&mdash;for which I have
no doubt I am also indebted to the plate&mdash;and left the
lonely Dodo in the morning, quite at peace with it, before the
bandy-legged baby was up.</p>
<h2><a name="page470"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 470</span>OUR
HONOURABLE FRIEND</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are delighted to find that he
has got in!&nbsp; Our honourable friend is triumphantly returned
to serve in the next Parliament.&nbsp; He is the honourable
member for Verbosity&mdash;the best represented place in
England.</p>
<p>Our honourable friend has issued an address of congratulation
to the Electors, which is worthy of that noble constituency, and
is a very pretty piece of composition.&nbsp; In electing him, he
says, they have covered themselves with glory, and England has
been true to herself.&nbsp; (In his preliminary address he had
remarked, in a poetical quotation of great rarity, that nought
could make us rue, if England to herself did prove but true.)</p>
<p>Our honourable friend delivers a prediction, in the same
document, that the feeble minions of a faction will never hold up
their heads any more; and that the finger of scorn will point at
them in their dejected state, through countless ages of
time.&nbsp; Further, that the hireling tools that would destroy
the sacred bulwarks of our nationality are unworthy of the name
of Englishman; and that so long as the sea shall roll around our
ocean-girded isle, so long his motto shall be, No
surrender.&nbsp; Certain dogged persons of low principles and no
intellect, have disputed whether anybody knows who the minions
are, or what the faction is, or which are the hireling tools and
which the sacred bulwarks, or what it is that is never to be
surrendered, and if not, why not?&nbsp; But, our honourable
friend the member for Verbosity knows all about it.</p>
<p>Our honourable friend has sat in several parliaments, and
given bushels of votes.&nbsp; He is a man of that profundity in
the matter of vote-giving, that you never know what he
means.&nbsp; When he seems to be voting pure white, he may be in
reality voting jet black.&nbsp; When he says Yes, it is just as
likely as not&mdash;or rather more so&mdash;that he means
No.&nbsp; This is the statesmanship of our honourable
friend.&nbsp; It is in this, that he differs from mere
unparliamentary men.&nbsp; You may not know what he meant then,
or what he means now; but, our honourable friend knows, and did
from the first know, both what he meant then, and what he means
now; and when he said he didn&rsquo;t mean it then, he did in
fact say, that he means it now.&nbsp; And if you mean to say that
you did not then, and do not now, know what he did mean then, or
does mean now, our honourable friend will be glad to receive an
explicit declaration from you whether you are prepared to destroy
the sacred bulwarks of our nationality.</p>
<p>Our honourable friend, the member for Verbosity, has this
great attribute, that he always means something, and always means
the same thing.&nbsp; When he came down to that House and
mournfully boasted in his place, as an individual member of the
assembled Commons of this great and happy country, that he could
lay his hand upon his heart, and solemnly declare that no
consideration on earth should induce him, at any time or under
any circumstances, to go as far north as Berwick-upon-Tweed; and
when he nevertheless, next year, did go to Berwick-upon-Tweed,
and even beyond it, to Edinburgh; he had one single meaning, one
and indivisible.&nbsp; And God forbid (our honourable friend
says) that he should waste another argument upon the man who
professes that he cannot understand it!&nbsp; &lsquo;I do <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span>, gentlemen,&rsquo; said our
honourable friend, with indignant emphasis and amid great
cheering, on one such public occasion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span>, gentlemen, I am free to confess,
envy the feelings of that man whose mind is so constituted as
that he can hold such language to me, and yet lay his head upon
his pillow, claiming to be a native of that land,</p>
<blockquote><p>Whose march is o&rsquo;er the mountain-wave,<br />
Whose home is on the deep!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Vehement cheering, and man expelled.)</p>
<p>When our honourable friend issued his preliminary address to
the constituent body of Verbosity on the occasion of one
particular glorious triumph, it was supposed by some of his
enemies, that even he would be placed in a situation of
difficulty by the following comparatively trifling conjunction of
circumstances.&nbsp; The dozen noblemen and gentlemen whom our
honourable friend supported, had &lsquo;come in,&rsquo; expressly
to do a certain thing.&nbsp; Now, four of the dozen said, at a
certain place, that they didn&rsquo;t mean to do that thing, and
had never meant to do it; another four of the dozen said, at
another certain place, that they did mean to do that thing, and
had always meant to do it; two of the remaining four said, at two
other certain places, that they meant to do half of that thing
(but differed about which half), and to do a variety of nameless
wonders instead of the other half; and one of the remaining two
declared that the thing itself was dead and buried, while the
other as strenuously protested that it was alive and
kicking.&nbsp; It was admitted that the parliamentary genius of
our honourable friend would be quite able to reconcile such small
discrepancies as these; but, there remained the additional
difficulty that each of the twelve made entirely different
statements at different places, and that all the twelve called
everything visible and invisible, sacred and profane, to witness,
that they were a perfectly impregnable phalanx of
unanimity.&nbsp; This, it was apprehended, would be a
stumbling-block to our honourable friend.</p>
<p>The difficulty came before our honourable friend, in this
way.&nbsp; He went down to Verbosity to meet his free and
independent constituents, and to render an account (as he
informed them in the local papers) of the trust they had confided
to his hands&mdash;that trust which it was one of the proudest
privileges of an Englishman to possess&mdash;that trust which it
was the proudest privilege of an Englishman to hold.&nbsp; It may
be mentioned as a proof of the great general interest attaching
to the contest, that a Lunatic whom nobody employed or knew, went
down to Verbosity with several thousand pounds in gold,
determined to give the whole away&mdash;which he actually did;
and that all the publicans opened their houses for nothing.&nbsp;
Likewise, several fighting men, and a patriotic group of burglars
sportively armed with life-preservers, proceeded (in barouches
and very drunk) to the scene of action at their own expense;
these children of nature having conceived a warm attachment to
our honourable friend, and intending, in their artless manner, to
testify it by knocking the voters in the opposite interest on the
head.</p>
<p>Our honourable friend being come into the presence of his
constituents, and having professed with great suavity that he was
delighted to see his good friend Tipkisson there, in his
working-dress&mdash;his good friend Tipkisson being an inveterate
saddler, who always opposes him, and for whom he has a mortal
hatred&mdash;made them a brisk, ginger-beery sort of speech, in
which he showed them how the dozen noblemen and gentlemen had (in
exactly ten days from their coming in) exercised a surprisingly
beneficial effect on the whole financial condition of Europe, had
altered the state of the exports and imports for the current
half-year, had prevented the drain of gold, had made all that
matter right about the glut of the raw material, and had restored
all sorts of balances with which the superseded noblemen and
gentlemen had played the deuce&mdash;and all this, with wheat at
so much a quarter, gold at so much an ounce, and the Bank of
England discounting good bills at so much per cent.!&nbsp; He
might be asked, he observed in a peroration of great power, what
were his principles?&nbsp; His principles were what they always
had been.&nbsp; His principles were written in the countenances
of the lion and unicorn; were stamped indelibly upon the royal
shield which those grand animals supported, and upon the free
words of fire which that shield bore.&nbsp; His principles were,
Britannia and her sea-king trident!&nbsp; His principles were,
commercial prosperity co-existently with perfect and profound
agricultural contentment; but short of this he would never
stop.&nbsp; His principles were, these,&mdash;with the addition
of his colours nailed to the mast, every man&rsquo;s heart in the
right place, every man&rsquo;s eye open, every man&rsquo;s hand
ready, every man&rsquo;s mind on the alert.&nbsp; His principles
were these, concurrently with a general revision of
something&mdash;speaking generally&mdash;and a possible
readjustment of something else, not to be mentioned more
particularly.&nbsp; His principles, to sum up all in a word,
were, Hearths and Altars, Labour and Capital, Crown and Sceptre,
Elephant and Castle.&nbsp; And now, if his good friend Tipkisson
required any further explanation from him, he (our honourable
friend) was there, willing and ready to give it.</p>
<p>Tipkisson, who all this time had stood conspicuous in the
crowd, with his arms folded and his eyes intently fastened on our
honourable friend: Tipkisson, who throughout our honourable
friend&rsquo;s address had not relaxed a muscle of his visage,
but had stood there, wholly unaffected by the torrent of
eloquence: an object of contempt and scorn to mankind (by which
we mean, of course, to the supporters of our honourable friend);
Tipkisson now said that he was a plain man (Cries of &lsquo;You
are indeed!&rsquo;), and that what he wanted to know was, what
our honourable friend and the dozen noblemen and gentlemen were
driving at?</p>
<p>Our honourable friend immediately replied, &lsquo;At the
illimitable perspective.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was considered by the whole assembly that this happy
statement of our honourable friend&rsquo;s political views ought,
immediately, to have settled Tipkisson&rsquo;s business and
covered him with confusion; but, that implacable person,
regardless of the execrations that were heaped upon him from all
sides (by which we mean, of course, from our honourable
friend&rsquo;s side), persisted in retaining an unmoved
countenance, and obstinately retorted that if our honourable
friend meant that, he wished to know what <i>that</i> meant?</p>
<p>It was in repelling this most objectionable and indecent
opposition, that our honourable friend displayed his highest
qualifications for the representation of Verbosity.&nbsp; His
warmest supporters present, and those who were best acquainted
with his generalship, supposed that the moment was come when he
would fall back upon the sacred bulwarks of our
nationality.&nbsp; No such thing.&nbsp; He replied thus:
&lsquo;My good friend Tipkisson, gentlemen, wishes to know what I
mean when he asks me what we are driving at, and when I candidly
tell him, at the illimitable perspective, he wishes (if I
understand him) to know what I mean?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
do!&rsquo; says Tipkisson, amid cries of &lsquo;Shame&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Down with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; says
our honourable friend, &lsquo;I will indulge my good friend
Tipkisson, by telling him, both what I mean and what I
don&rsquo;t mean.&nbsp; (Cheers and cries of &lsquo;Give it
him!&rsquo;)&nbsp; Be it known to him then, and to all whom it
may concern, that I do mean altars, hearths, and homes, and that
I don&rsquo;t mean mosques and Mohammedanism!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
effect of this home-thrust was terrific.&nbsp; Tipkisson (who is
a Baptist) was hooted down and hustled out, and has ever since
been regarded as a Turkish Renegade who contemplates an early
pilgrimage to Mecca.&nbsp; Nor was he the only discomfited
man.&nbsp; The charge, while it stuck to him, was magically
transferred to our honourable friend&rsquo;s opponent, who was
represented in an immense variety of placards as a firm believer
in Mahomet; and the men of Verbosity were asked to choose between
our honourable friend and the Bible, and our honourable
friend&rsquo;s opponent and the Koran.&nbsp; They decided for our
honourable friend, and rallied round the illimitable
perspective.</p>
<p>It has been claimed for our honourable friend, with much
appearance of reason, that he was the first to bend sacred
matters to electioneering tactics.&nbsp; However this may be, the
fine precedent was undoubtedly set in a Verbosity election: and
it is certain that our honourable friend (who was a disciple of
Brahma in his youth, and was a Buddhist when we had the honour of
travelling with him a few years ago) always professes in public
more anxiety than the whole Bench of Bishops, regarding the
theological and doxological opinions of every man, woman, and
child, in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>As we began by saying that our honourable friend has got in
again at this last election, and that we are delighted to find
that he has got in, so we will conclude.&nbsp; Our honourable
friend cannot come in for Verbosity too often.&nbsp; It is a good
sign; it is a great example.&nbsp; It is to men like our
honourable friend, and to contests like those from which he comes
triumphant, that we are mainly indebted for that ready interest
in politics, that fresh enthusiasm in the discharge of the duties
of citizenship, that ardent desire to rush to the poll, at
present so manifest throughout England.&nbsp; When the contest
lies (as it sometimes does) between two such men as our
honourable friend, it stimulates the finest emotions of our
nature, and awakens the highest admiration of which our heads and
hearts are capable.</p>
<p>It is not too much to predict that our honourable friend will
be always at his post in the ensuing session.&nbsp; Whatever the
question be, or whatever the form of its discussion; address to
the crown, election petition, expenditure of the public money,
extension of the public suffrage, education, crime; in the whole
house, in committee of the whole house, in select committee; in
every parliamentary discussion of every subject, everywhere: the
Honourable Member for Verbosity will most certainly be found.</p>
<h2><a name="page475"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 475</span>OUR
SCHOOL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> went to look at it, only this
last Midsummer, and found that the Railway had cut it up root and
branch.&nbsp; A great trunk-line had swallowed the playground,
sliced away the schoolroom, and pared off the corner of the
house: which, thus curtailed of its proportions, presented
itself, in a green stage of stucco, profilewise towards the road,
like a forlorn flat-iron without a handle, standing on end.</p>
<p>It seems as if our schools were doomed to be the sport of
change.&nbsp; We have faint recollections of a Preparatory
Day-School, which we have sought in vain, and which must have
been pulled down to make a new street, ages ago.&nbsp; We have
dim impressions, scarcely amounting to a belief, that it was over
a dyer&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; We know that you went up steps to it;
that you frequently grazed your knees in doing so; that you
generally got your leg over the scraper, in trying to scrape the
mud off a very unsteady little shoe.&nbsp; The mistress of the
Establishment holds no place in our memory; but, rampant on one
eternal door-mat, in an eternal entry long and narrow, is a puffy
pug-dog, with a personal animosity towards us, who triumphs over
Time.&nbsp; The bark of that baleful Pug, a certain radiating way
he had of snapping at our undefended legs, the ghastly grinning
of his moist black muzzle and white teeth, and the insolence of
his crisp tail curled like a pastoral crook, all live and
flourish.&nbsp; From an otherwise unaccountable association of
him with a fiddle, we conclude that he was of French extraction,
and his name <i>Fid&egrave;le</i>.&nbsp; He belonged to some
female, chiefly inhabiting a back-parlour, whose life appears to
us to have been consumed in sniffing, and in wearing a brown
beaver bonnet.&nbsp; For her, he would sit up and balance cake
upon his nose, and not eat it until twenty had been
counted.&nbsp; To the best of our belief we were once called in
to witness this performance; when, unable, even in his milder
moments, to endure our presence, he instantly made at us, cake
and all.</p>
<p>Why a something in mourning, called &lsquo;Miss Frost,&rsquo;
should still connect itself with our preparatory school, we are
unable to say.&nbsp; We retain no impression of the beauty of
Miss Frost&mdash;if she were beautiful; or of the mental
fascinations of Miss Frost&mdash;if she were accomplished; yet
her name and her black dress hold an enduring place in our
remembrance.&nbsp; An equally impersonal boy, whose name has long
since shaped itself unalterably into &lsquo;Master Mawls,&rsquo;
is not to be dislodged from our brain.&nbsp; Retaining no
vindictive feeling towards Mawls&mdash;no feeling whatever,
indeed&mdash;we infer that neither he nor we can have loved Miss
Frost.&nbsp; Our first impression of Death and Burial is
associated with this formless pair.&nbsp; We all three nestled
awfully in a corner one wintry day, when the wind was blowing
shrill, with Miss Frost&rsquo;s pinafore over our heads; and Miss
Frost told us in a whisper about somebody being &lsquo;screwed
down.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the only distinct recollection we
preserve of these impalpable creatures, except a suspicion that
the manners of Master Mawls were susceptible of much
improvement.&nbsp; Generally speaking, we may observe that
whenever we see a child intently occupied with its nose, to the
exclusion of all other subjects of interest, our mind reverts, in
a flash, to Master Mawls.</p>
<p>But, the School that was Our School before the Railroad came
and overthrew it, was quite another sort of place.&nbsp; We were
old enough to be put into Virgil when we went there, and to get
Prizes for a variety of polishing on which the rust has long
accumulated.&nbsp; It was a School of some celebrity in its
neighbourhood&mdash;nobody could have said why&mdash;and we had
the honour to attain and hold the eminent position of first
boy.&nbsp; The master was supposed among us to know nothing, and
one of the ushers was supposed to know everything.&nbsp; We are
still inclined to think the first-named supposition perfectly
correct.</p>
<p>We have a general idea that its subject had been in the
leather trade, and had bought us&mdash;meaning Our
School&mdash;of another proprietor who was immensely
learned.&nbsp; Whether this belief had any real foundation, we
are not likely ever to know now.&nbsp; The only branches of
education with which he showed the least acquaintance, were,
ruling and corporally punishing.&nbsp; He was always ruling
ciphering-books with a bloated mahogany ruler, or smiting the
palms of offenders with the same diabolical instrument, or
viciously drawing a pair of pantaloons tight with one of his
large hands, and caning the wearer with the other.&nbsp; We have
no doubt whatever that this occupation was the principal solace
of his existence.</p>
<p>A profound respect for money pervaded Our School, which was,
of course, derived from its Chief.&nbsp; We remember an idiotic
goggle-eyed boy, with a big head and half-crowns without end, who
suddenly appeared as a parlour-boarder, and was rumoured to have
come by sea from some mysterious part of the earth where his
parents rolled in gold.&nbsp; He was usually called
&lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; by the Chief, and was said to feed in the
parlour on steaks and gravy; likewise to drink currant
wine.&nbsp; And he openly stated that if rolls and coffee were
ever denied him at breakfast, he would write home to that unknown
part of the globe from which he had come, and cause himself to be
recalled to the regions of gold.&nbsp; He was put into no form or
class, but learnt alone, as little as he liked&mdash;and he liked
very little&mdash;and there was a belief among us that this was
because he was too wealthy to be &lsquo;taken down.&rsquo;&nbsp;
His special treatment, and our vague association of him with the
sea, and with storms, and sharks, and Coral Reefs occasioned the
wildest legends to be circulated as his history.&nbsp; A tragedy
in blank verse was written on the subject&mdash;if our memory
does not deceive us, by the hand that now chronicles these
recollections&mdash;in which his father figured as a Pirate, and
was shot for a voluminous catalogue of atrocities: first
imparting to his wife the secret of the cave in which his wealth
was stored, and from which his only son&rsquo;s half-crowns now
issued.&nbsp; Dumbledon (the boy&rsquo;s name) was represented as
&lsquo;yet unborn&rsquo; when his brave father met his fate; and
the despair and grief of Mrs. Dumbledon at that calamity was
movingly shadowed forth as having weakened the
parlour-boarder&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; This production was received
with great favour, and was twice performed with closed doors in
the dining-room.&nbsp; But, it got wind, and was seized as
libellous, and brought the unlucky poet into severe
affliction.&nbsp; Some two years afterwards, all of a sudden one
day, Dumbledon vanished.&nbsp; It was whispered that the Chief
himself had taken him down to the Docks, and re-shipped him for
the Spanish Main; but nothing certain was ever known about his
disappearance.&nbsp; At this hour, we cannot thoroughly
disconnect him from California.</p>
<p>Our School was rather famous for mysterious pupils.&nbsp;
There was another&mdash;a heavy young man, with a large
double-cased silver watch, and a fat knife the handle of which
was a perfect tool-box&mdash;who unaccountably appeared one day
at a special desk of his own, erected close to that of the Chief,
with whom he held familiar converse.&nbsp; He lived in the
parlour, and went out for his walks, and never took the least
notice of us&mdash;even of us, the first boy&mdash;unless to give
us a deprecatory kick, or grimly to take our hat off and throw it
away, when he encountered us out of doors, which unpleasant
ceremony he always performed as he passed&mdash;not even
condescending to stop for the purpose.&nbsp; Some of us believed
that the classical attainments of this phenomenon were terrific,
but that his penmanship and arithmetic were defective, and he had
come there to mend them; others, that he was going to set up a
school, and had paid the Chief &lsquo;twenty-five pound
down,&rsquo; for leave to see Our School at work.&nbsp; The
gloomier spirits even said that he was going to buy us; against
which contingency, conspiracies were set on foot for a general
defection and running away.&nbsp; However, he never did
that.&nbsp; After staying for a quarter, during which period,
though closely observed, he was never seen to do anything but
make pens out of quills, write small hand in a secret portfolio,
and punch the point of the sharpest blade in his knife into his
desk all over it, he too disappeared, and his place knew him no
more.</p>
<p>There was another boy, a fair, meek boy, with a delicate
complexion and rich curling hair, who, we found out, or thought
we found out (we have no idea now, and probably had none then, on
what grounds, but it was confidentially revealed from mouth to
mouth), was the son of a Viscount who had deserted his lovely
mother.&nbsp; It was understood that if he had his rights, he
would be worth twenty thousand a year.&nbsp; And that if his
mother ever met his father, she would shoot him with a silver
pistol, which she carried, always loaded to the muzzle, for that
purpose.&nbsp; He was a very suggestive topic.&nbsp; So was a
young Mulatto, who was always believed (though very amiable) to
have a dagger about him somewhere.&nbsp; But, we think they were
both outshone, upon the whole, by another boy who claimed to have
been born on the twenty-ninth of February, and to have only one
birthday in five years.&nbsp; We suspect this to have been a
fiction&mdash;but he lived upon it all the time he was at Our
School.</p>
<p>The principal currency of Our School was slate pencil.&nbsp;
It had some inexplicable value, that was never ascertained, never
reduced to a standard.&nbsp; To have a great hoard of it was
somehow to be rich.&nbsp; We used to bestow it in charity, and
confer it as a precious boon upon our chosen friends.&nbsp; When
the holidays were coming, contributions were solicited for
certain boys whose relatives were in India, and who were appealed
for under the generic name of
&lsquo;Holiday-stoppers,&rsquo;&mdash;appropriate marks of
remembrance that should enliven and cheer them in their homeless
state.&nbsp; Personally, we always contributed these tokens of
sympathy in the form of slate pencil, and always felt that it
would be a comfort and a treasure to them.</p>
<p>Our School was remarkable for white mice.&nbsp; Red-polls,
linnets, and even canaries, were kept in desks, drawers,
hat-boxes, and other strange refuges for birds; but white mice
were the favourite stock.&nbsp; The boys trained the mice, much
better than the masters trained the boys.&nbsp; We recall one
white mouse, who lived in the cover of a Latin dictionary, who
ran up ladders, drew Roman chariots, shouldered muskets, turned
wheels, and even made a very creditable appearance on the stage
as the Dog of Montargis.&nbsp; He might have achieved greater
things, but for having the misfortune to mistake his way in a
triumphal procession to the Capitol, when he fell into a deep
inkstand, and was dyed black and drowned.&nbsp; The mice were the
occasion of some most ingenious engineering, in the construction
of their houses and instruments of performance.&nbsp; The famous
one belonged to a company of proprietors, some of whom have since
made Railroads, Engines, and Telegraphs; the chairman has erected
mills and bridges in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The usher at Our School, who was considered to know everything
as opposed to the Chief, who was considered to know nothing, was
a bony, gentle-faced, clerical-looking young man in rusty
black.&nbsp; It was whispered that he was sweet upon one of
Maxby&rsquo;s sisters (Maxby lived close by, and was a day
pupil), and further that he &lsquo;favoured Maxby.&rsquo;&nbsp;
As we remember, he taught Italian to Maxby&rsquo;s sisters on
half-holidays.&nbsp; He once went to the play with them, and wore
a white waistcoat and a rose: which was considered among us
equivalent to a declaration.&nbsp; We were of opinion on that
occasion, that to the last moment he expected Maxby&rsquo;s
father to ask him to dinner at five o&rsquo;clock, and therefore
neglected his own dinner at half-past one, and finally got
none.&nbsp; We exaggerated in our imaginations the extent to
which he punished Maxby&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s cold meat at
supper; and we agreed to believe that he was elevated with wine
and water when he came home.&nbsp; But, we all liked him; for he
had a good knowledge of boys, and would have made it a much
better school if he had had more power.&nbsp; He was writing
master, mathematical master, English master, made out the bills,
mended the pens, and did all sorts of things.&nbsp; He divided
the little boys with the Latin master (they were smuggled through
their rudimentary books, at odd times when there was nothing else
to do), and he always called at parents&rsquo; houses to inquire
after sick boys, because he had gentlemanly manners.&nbsp; He was
rather musical, and on some remote quarter-day had bought an old
trombone; but a bit of it was lost, and it made the most
extraordinary sounds when he sometimes tried to play it of an
evening.&nbsp; His holidays never began (on account of the bills)
until long after ours; but, in the summer vacations he used to
take pedestrian excursions with a knapsack; and at Christmas
time, he went to see his father at Chipping Norton, who we all
said (on no authority) was a dairy-fed pork-butcher.&nbsp; Poor
fellow!&nbsp; He was very low all day on Maxby&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s wedding-day, and afterwards was thought to favour
Maxby more than ever, though he had been expected to spite
him.&nbsp; He has been dead these twenty years.&nbsp; Poor
fellow!</p>
<p>Our remembrance of Our School, presents the Latin master as a
colourless doubled-up near-sighted man with a crutch, who was
always cold, and always putting onions into his ears for
deafness, and always disclosing ends of flannel under all his
garments, and almost always applying a ball of
pocket-handkerchief to some part of his face with a screwing
action round and round.&nbsp; He was a very good scholar, and
took great pains where he saw intelligence and a desire to learn:
otherwise, perhaps not.&nbsp; Our memory presents him (unless
teased into a passion) with as little energy as colour&mdash;as
having been worried and tormented into monotonous
feebleness&mdash;as having had the best part of his life ground
out of him in a Mill of boys.&nbsp; We remember with terror how
he fell asleep one sultry afternoon with the little smuggled
class before him, and awoke not when the footstep of the Chief
fell heavy on the floor; how the Chief aroused him, in the midst
of a dread silence, and said, &lsquo;Mr. Blinkins, are you ill,
sir?&rsquo; how he blushingly replied, &lsquo;Sir, rather
so;&rsquo; how the Chief retorted with severity, &lsquo;Mr.
Blinkins, this is no place to be ill in&rsquo; (which was very,
very true), and walked back solemn as the ghost in Hamlet, until,
catching a wandering eye, he called that boy for inattention, and
happily expressed his feelings towards the Latin master through
the medium of a substitute.</p>
<p>There was a fat little dancing-master who used to come in a
gig, and taught the more advanced among us hornpipes (as an
accomplishment in great social demand in after life); and there
was a brisk little French master who used to come in the sunniest
weather, with a handleless umbrella, and to whom the Chief was
always polite, because (as we believed), if the Chief offended
him, he would instantly address the Chief in French, and for ever
confound him before the boys with his inability to understand or
reply.</p>
<p>There was besides, a serving man, whose name was Phil.&nbsp;
Our retrospective glance presents Phil as a shipwrecked
carpenter, cast away upon the desert island of a school, and
carrying into practice an ingenious inkling of many trades.&nbsp;
He mended whatever was broken, and made whatever was
wanted.&nbsp; He was general glazier, among other things, and
mended all the broken windows&mdash;at the prime cost (as was
darkly rumoured among us) of ninepence, for every square charged
three-and-six to parents.&nbsp; We had a high opinion of his
mechanical genius, and generally held that the Chief &lsquo;knew
something bad of him,&rsquo; and on pain of divulgence enforced
Phil to be his bondsman.&nbsp; We particularly remember that Phil
had a sovereign contempt for learning: which engenders in us a
respect for his sagacity, as it implies his accurate observation
of the relative positions of the Chief and the ushers.&nbsp; He
was an impenetrable man, who waited at table between whiles, and
throughout &lsquo;the half&rsquo; kept the boxes in severe
custody.&nbsp; He was morose, even to the Chief, and never
smiled, except at breaking-up, when, in acknowledgment of the
toast, &lsquo;Success to Phil!&nbsp; Hooray!&rsquo; he would
slowly carve a grin out of his wooden face, where it would remain
until we were all gone.&nbsp; Nevertheless, one time when we had
the scarlet fever in the school, Phil nursed all the sick boys of
his own accord, and was like a mother to them.</p>
<p>There was another school not far off, and of course Our School
could have nothing to say to that school.&nbsp; It is mostly the
way with schools, whether of boys or men.&nbsp; Well! the railway
has swallowed up ours, and the locomotives now run smoothly over
its ashes.</p>
<blockquote><p>So fades and languishes, grows dim and dies,<br />
All that this world is proud of,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- and is not proud of, too.&nbsp; It had little reason to be
proud of Our School, and has done much better since in that way,
and will do far better yet.</p>
<h2><a name="page481"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 481</span>OUR
VESTRY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have the glorious privilege of
being always in hot water if we like.&nbsp; We are a shareholder
in a Great Parochial British Joint Stock Bank of
Balderdash.&nbsp; We have a Vestry in our borough, and can vote
for a vestryman&mdash;might even <i>be</i> a vestryman, mayhap,
if we were inspired by a lofty and noble ambition.&nbsp; Which we
are not.</p>
<p>Our Vestry is a deliberative assembly of the utmost dignity
and importance.&nbsp; Like the Senate of ancient Rome, its awful
gravity overpowers (or ought to overpower) barbarian
visitors.&nbsp; It sits in the Capitol (we mean in the capital
building erected for it), chiefly on Saturdays, and shakes the
earth to its centre with the echoes of its thundering eloquence,
in a Sunday paper.</p>
<p>To get into this Vestry in the eminent capacity of Vestryman,
gigantic efforts are made, and Herculean exertions used.&nbsp; It
is made manifest to the dullest capacity at every election, that
if we reject Snozzle we are done for, and that if we fail to
bring in Blunderbooze at the top of the poll, we are unworthy of
the dearest rights of Britons.&nbsp; Flaming placards are rife on
all the dead walls in the borough, public-houses hang out
banners, hackney-cabs burst into full-grown flowers of type, and
everybody is, or should be, in a paroxysm of anxiety.</p>
<p>At these momentous crises of the national fate, we are much
assisted in our deliberations by two eminent volunteers; one of
whom subscribes himself A Fellow Parishioner, the other, A
Rate-Payer.&nbsp; Who they are, or what they are, or where they
are, nobody knows; but, whatever one asserts, the other
contradicts.&nbsp; They are both voluminous writers, indicting
more epistles than Lord Chesterfield in a single week; and the
greater part of their feelings are too big for utterance in
anything less than capital letters.&nbsp; They require the
additional aid of whole rows of notes of admiration, like
balloons, to point their generous indignation; and they sometimes
communicate a crushing severity to stars.&nbsp; As thus:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">MEN OF MOONEYMOUNT.</p>

of &pound;2,745 6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, yet claim to be a <span

<p>Is it, or is it not, a * * * to state as a fact what is proved

<p>Your consideration of these questions is recommended to you
by</p>
<p style="text-align: right">A <span class="smcap">Fellow
Parishioner</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was to this important public document that one of our first
orators, <span class="smcap">Mr. Magg</span> (of Little Winkling
Street), adverted, when he opened the great debate of the
fourteenth of November by saying, &lsquo;Sir, I hold in my hand
an anonymous slander&rsquo;&mdash;and when the interruption, with
which he was at that point assailed by the opposite faction, gave
rise to that memorable discussion on a point of order which will
ever be remembered with interest by constitutional
assemblies.&nbsp; In the animated debate to which we refer, no
fewer than thirty-seven gentlemen, many of them of great
eminence, including <span class="smcap">Mr. Wigsby</span> (of
Chumbledon Square), were seen upon their legs at one time; and it
was on the same great occasion that <span
class="smcap">Dogginson</span>&mdash;regarded in our Vestry as
&lsquo;a regular John Bull:&rsquo; we believe, in consequence of
his having always made up his mind on every subject without
knowing anything about it&mdash;informed another gentleman of
similar principles on the opposite side, that if he
&lsquo;cheek&rsquo;d him,&rsquo; he would resort to the extreme
measure of knocking his blessed head off.</p>
<p>This was a great occasion.&nbsp; But, our Vestry shines
habitually.&nbsp; In asserting its own pre-eminence, for
instance, it is very strong.&nbsp; On the least provocation, or
on none, it will be clamorous to know whether it is to be
&lsquo;dictated to,&rsquo; or &lsquo;trampled on,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;ridden over rough-shod.&rsquo;&nbsp; Its great watchword
is Self-government.&nbsp; That is to say, supposing our Vestry to
favour any little harmless disorder like Typhus Fever, and
supposing the Government of the country to be, by any accident,
in such ridiculous hands, as that any of its authorities should
consider it a duty to object to Typhus Fever&mdash;obviously an
unconstitutional objection&mdash;then, our Vestry cuts in with a
terrible manifesto about Self-government, and claims its
independent right to have as much Typhus Fever as pleases
itself.&nbsp; Some absurd and dangerous persons have represented,
on the other hand, that though our Vestry may be able to
&lsquo;beat the bounds&rsquo; of its own parish, it may not be
able to beat the bounds of its own diseases; which (say they)
spread over the whole land, in an ever expanding circle of waste,
and misery, and death, and widowhood, and orphanage, and
desolation.&nbsp; But, our Vestry makes short work of any such
fellows as these.</p>
<p>It was our Vestry&mdash;pink of Vestries as it is&mdash;that
in support of its favourite principle took the celebrated ground
of denying the existence of the last pestilence that raged in
England, when the pestilence was raging at the Vestry
doors.&nbsp; Dogginson said it was plums; Mr. Wigsby (of
Chumbledon Square) said it was oysters; Mr. Magg (of Little
Winkling Street) said, amid great cheering, it was the
newspapers.&nbsp; The noble indignation of our Vestry with that
un-English institution the Board of Health, under those
circumstances, yields one of the finest passages in its
history.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t hear of rescue.&nbsp; Like Mr.
Joseph Miller&rsquo;s Frenchman, it would be drowned and nobody
should save it.&nbsp; Transported beyond grammar by its kindled
ire, it spoke in unknown tongues, and vented unintelligible
bellowings, more like an ancient oracle than the modern oracle it
is admitted on all hands to be.&nbsp; Rare exigencies produce
rare things; and even our Vestry, new hatched to the woful time,
came forth a greater goose than ever.</p>
<p>But this, again, was a special occasion.&nbsp; Our Vestry, at
more ordinary periods, demands its meed of praise.</p>
<p>Our Vestry is eminently parliamentary.&nbsp; Playing at
Parliament is its favourite game.&nbsp; It is even regarded by
some of its members as a chapel of ease to the House of Commons:
a Little Go to be passed first.&nbsp; It has its strangers&rsquo;
gallery, and its reported debates (see the Sunday paper before
mentioned), and our Vestrymen are in and out of order, and on and
off their legs, and above all are transcendently quarrelsome,
after the pattern of the real original.</p>
<p>Our Vestry being assembled, Mr. Magg never begs to trouble Mr.
Wigsby with a simple inquiry.&nbsp; He knows better than
that.&nbsp; Seeing the honourable gentleman, associated in their
minds with Chumbledon Square, in his place, he wishes to ask that
honourable gentleman what the intentions of himself, and those
with whom he acts, may be, on the subject of the paving of the
district known as Piggleum Buildings?&nbsp; Mr. Wigsby replies
(with his eye on next Sunday&rsquo;s paper) that in reference to
the question which has been put to him by the honourable
gentleman opposite, he must take leave to say, that if that
honourable gentleman had had the courtesy to give him notice of
that question, he (Mr. Wigsby) would have consulted with his
colleagues in reference to the advisability, in the present state
of the discussions on the new paving-rate, of answering that
question.&nbsp; But, as the honourable gentleman has <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> had the courtesy to give him notice
of that question (great cheering from the Wigsby interest), he
must decline to give the honourable gentleman the satisfaction he
requires.&nbsp; Mr. Magg, instantly rising to retort, is received
with loud cries of &lsquo;Spoke!&rsquo; from the Wigsby interest,
and with cheers from the Magg side of the house.&nbsp; Moreover,
five gentlemen rise to order, and one of them, in revenge for
being taken no notice of, petrifies the assembly by moving that
this Vestry do now adjourn; but, is persuaded to withdraw that
awful proposal, in consideration of its tremendous consequences
if persevered in.&nbsp; Mr. Magg, for the purpose of being heard,
then begs to move, that you, sir, do now pass to the order of the
day; and takes that opportunity of saying, that if an honourable
gentleman whom he has in his eye, and will not demean himself by
more particularly naming (oh, oh, and cheers), supposes that he
is to be put down by clamour, that honourable
gentleman&mdash;however supported he may be, through thick and
thin, by a Fellow Parishioner, with whom he is well acquainted
(cheers and counter-cheers, Mr. Magg being invariably backed by
the Rate-Payer)&mdash;will find himself mistaken.&nbsp; Upon
this, twenty members of our Vestry speak in succession concerning
what the two great men have meant, until it appears, after an
hour and twenty minutes, that neither of them meant
anything.&nbsp; Then our Vestry begins business.</p>
<p>We have said that, after the pattern of the real original, our
Vestry in playing at Parliament is transcendently
quarrelsome.&nbsp; It enjoys a personal altercation above all
things.&nbsp; Perhaps the most redoubtable case of this kind we
have ever had&mdash;though we have had so many that it is
difficult to decide&mdash;was that on which the last extreme
solemnities passed between Mr. Tiddypot (of Gumption House) and
Captain Banger (of Wilderness Walk).</p>
<p>In an adjourned debate on the question whether water could be
regarded in the light of a necessary of life; respecting which
there were great differences of opinion, and many shades of
sentiment; Mr. Tiddypot, in a powerful burst of eloquence against
that hypothesis, frequently made use of the expression that such
and such a rumour had &lsquo;reached his ears.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Captain Banger, following him, and holding that, for purposes of
ablution and refreshment, a pint of water per diem was necessary
for every adult of the lower classes, and half a pint for every
child, cast ridicule upon his address in a sparkling speech, and
concluded by saying that instead of those rumours having reached
the ears of the honourable gentleman, he rather thought the
honourable gentleman&rsquo;s ears must have reached the rumours,
in consequence of their well-known length.&nbsp; Mr. Tiddypot
immediately rose, looked the honourable and gallant gentleman
full in the face, and left the Vestry.</p>
<p>The excitement, at this moment painfully intense, was
heightened to an acute degree when Captain Banger rose, and also
left the Vestry.&nbsp; After a few moments of profound
silence&mdash;one of those breathless pauses never to be
forgotten&mdash;Mr. Chib (of Tucket&rsquo;s Terrace, and the
father of the Vestry) rose.&nbsp; He said that words and looks
had passed in that assembly, replete with consequences which
every feeling mind must deplore.&nbsp; Time pressed.&nbsp; The
sword was drawn, and while he spoke the scabbard might be thrown
away.&nbsp; He moved that those honourable gentlemen who had left
the Vestry be recalled, and required to pledge themselves upon
their honour that this affair should go no farther.&nbsp; The
motion being by a general union of parties unanimously agreed to
(for everybody wanted to have the belligerents there, instead of
out of sight: which was no fun at all), Mr. Magg was deputed to
recover Captain Banger, and Mr. Chib himself to go in search of
Mr. Tiddypot.&nbsp; The Captain was found in a conspicuous
position, surveying the passing omnibuses from the top step of
the front-door immediately adjoining the beadle&rsquo;s box; Mr.
Tiddypot made a desperate attempt at resistance, but was
overpowered by Mr. Chib (a remarkably hale old gentleman of
eighty-two), and brought back in safety.</p>
<p>Mr. Tiddypot and the Captain being restored to their places,
and glaring on each other, were called upon by the chair to
abandon all homicidal intentions, and give the Vestry an
assurance that they did so.&nbsp; Mr. Tiddypot remained
profoundly silent.&nbsp; The Captain likewise remained profoundly
silent, saying that he was observed by those around him to fold
his arms like Napoleon Buonaparte, and to snort in his
breathing&mdash;actions but too expressive of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The most intense emotion now prevailed.&nbsp; Several members
clustered in remonstrance round the Captain, and several round
Mr. Tiddypot; but, both were obdurate.&nbsp; Mr. Chib then
presented himself amid tremendous cheering, and said, that not to
shrink from the discharge of his painful duty, he must now move
that both honourable gentlemen be taken into custody by the
beadle, and conveyed to the nearest police-office, there to be
held to bail.&nbsp; The union of parties still continuing, the
motion was seconded by Mr. Wigsby&mdash;on all usual occasions
Mr. Chib&rsquo;s opponent&mdash;and rapturously carried with only
one dissentient voice.&nbsp; This was Dogginson&rsquo;s, who said
from his place &lsquo;Let &rsquo;em fight it out with
fistes;&rsquo; but whose coarse remark was received as it
merited.</p>
<p>The beadle now advanced along the floor of the Vestry, and
beckoned with his cocked hat to both members.&nbsp; Every breath
was suspended.&nbsp; To say that a pin might have been heard to
fall, would be feebly to express the all-absorbing interest and
silence.&nbsp; Suddenly, enthusiastic cheering broke out from
every side of the Vestry.&nbsp; Captain Banger had
risen&mdash;being, in fact, pulled up by a friend on either side,
and poked up by a friend behind.</p>
<p>The Captain said, in a deep determined voice, that he had
every respect for that Vestry and every respect for that chair;
that he also respected the honourable gentleman of Gumpton House;
but, that he respected his honour more.&nbsp; Hereupon the
Captain sat down, leaving the whole Vestry much affected.&nbsp;
Mr. Tiddypot instantly rose, and was received with the same
encouragement.&nbsp; He likewise said&mdash;and the exquisite art
of this orator communicated to the observation an air of
freshness and novelty&mdash;that he too had every respect for
that Vestry; that he too had every respect for that chair.&nbsp;
That he too respected the honourable and gallant gentleman of
Wilderness Walk; but, that he too respected his honour more.
&lsquo;Hows&rsquo;ever,&rsquo; added the distinguished Vestryman,
&lsquo;if the honourable and gallant gentleman&rsquo;s honour is
never more doubted and damaged than it is by me, he&rsquo;s all
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; Captain Banger immediately started up again,
and said that after those observations, involving as they did
ample concession to his honour without compromising the honour of
the honourable gentleman, he would be wanting in honour as well
as in generosity, if he did not at once repudiate all intention
of wounding the honour of the honourable gentleman, or saying
anything dishonourable to his honourable feelings.&nbsp; These
observations were repeatedly interrupted by bursts of
cheers.&nbsp; Mr. Tiddypot retorted that he well knew the spirit
of honour by which the honourable and gallant gentleman was so
honourably animated, and that he accepted an honourable
explanation, offered in a way that did him honour; but, he
trusted that the Vestry would consider that his (Mr.
Tiddypot&rsquo;s) honour had imperatively demanded of him that
painful course which he had felt it due to his honour to
adopt.&nbsp; The Captain and Mr. Tiddypot then touched their hats
to one another across the Vestry, a great many times, and it is
thought that these proceedings (reported to the extent of several
columns in next Sunday&rsquo;s paper) will bring them in as
church-wardens next year.</p>
<p>All this was strictly after the pattern of the real original,
and so are the whole of our Vestry&rsquo;s proceedings.&nbsp; In
all their debates, they are laudably imitative of the windy and
wordy slang of the real original, and of nothing that is better
in it.&nbsp; They have head-strong party animosities, without any
reference to the merits of questions; they tack a surprising
amount of debate to a very little business; they set more store
by forms than they do by substances:&mdash;all very like the real
original!&nbsp; It has been doubted in our borough, whether our
Vestry is of any utility; but our own conclusion is, that it is
of the use to the Borough that a diminishing mirror is to a
painter, as enabling it to perceive in a small focus of absurdity
all the surface defects of the real original.</p>
<h2><a name="page487"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 487</span>OUR
BORE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is unnecessary to say that we
keep a bore.&nbsp; Everybody does.&nbsp; But, the bore whom we
have the pleasure and honour of enumerating among our particular
friends, is such a generic bore, and has so many traits (as it
appears to us) in common with the great bore family, that we are
tempted to make him the subject of the present notes.&nbsp; May
he be generally accepted!</p>
<p>Our bore is admitted on all hands to be a good-hearted
man.&nbsp; He may put fifty people out of temper, but he keeps
his own.&nbsp; He preserves a sickly solid smile upon his face,
when other faces are ruffled by the perfection he has attained in
his art, and has an equable voice which never travels out of one
key or rises above one pitch.&nbsp; His manner is a manner of
tranquil interest.&nbsp; None of his opinions are
startling.&nbsp; Among his deepest-rooted convictions, it may be
mentioned that he considers the air of England damp, and holds
that our lively neighbours&mdash;he always calls the French our
lively neighbours&mdash;have the advantage of us in that
particular.&nbsp; Nevertheless he is unable to forget that John
Bull is John Bull all the world over, and that England with all
her faults is England still.</p>
<p>Our bore has travelled.&nbsp; He could not possibly be a
complete bore without having travelled.&nbsp; He rarely speaks of
his travels without introducing, sometimes on his own plan of
construction, morsels of the language of the country&mdash;which
he always translates.&nbsp; You cannot name to him any little
remote town in France, Italy, Germany, or Switzerland but he
knows it well; stayed there a fortnight under peculiar
circumstances.&nbsp; And talking of that little place, perhaps
you know a statue over an old fountain, up a little court, which
is the second&mdash;no, the third&mdash;stay&mdash;yes, the third
turning on the right, after you come out of the Post-house, going
up the hill towards the market?&nbsp; You <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know
that statue?&nbsp; Nor that fountain?&nbsp; You surprise
him!&nbsp; They are not usually seen by travellers (most
extraordinary, he has never yet met with a single traveller who
knew them, except one German, the most intelligent man he ever
met in his life!) but he thought that <span
class="GutSmall">YOU</span> would have been the man to find them
out.&nbsp; And then he describes them, in a circumstantial
lecture half an hour long, generally delivered behind a door
which is constantly being opened from the other side; and
implores you, if you ever revisit that place, now do go and look
at that statue and fountain!</p>
<p>Our bore, in a similar manner, being in Italy, made a
discovery of a dreadful picture, which has been the terror of a
large portion of the civilized world ever since.&nbsp; We have
seen the liveliest men paralysed by it, across a broad
dining-table.&nbsp; He was lounging among the mountains, sir,
basking in the mellow influences of the climate, when he came to
<i>una piccola chiesa</i>&mdash;a little church&mdash;or perhaps
it would be more correct to say <i>una piccolissima
cappella</i>&mdash;the smallest chapel you can possibly
imagine&mdash;and walked in.&nbsp; There was nobody inside but a
<i>cieco</i>&mdash;a blind man&mdash;saying his prayers, and a
<i>vecchio padre</i>&mdash;old friar-rattling a money-box.&nbsp;
But, above the head of that friar, and immediately to the right
of the altar as you enter&mdash;to the right of the altar?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; To the left of the altar as you enter&mdash;or say near
the centre&mdash;there hung a painting (subject, Virgin and
Child) so divine in its expression, so pure and yet so warm and
rich in its tone, so fresh in its touch, at once so glowing in
its colour and so statuesque in its repose, that our bore cried
out in ecstasy, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the finest picture in
Italy!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so it is, sir.&nbsp; There is no doubt of
it.&nbsp; It is astonishing that that picture is so little
known.&nbsp; Even the painter is uncertain.&nbsp; He afterwards
took Blumb, of the Royal Academy (it is to be observed that our
bore takes none but eminent people to see sights, and that none
but eminent people take our bore), and you never saw a man so
affected in your life as Blumb was.&nbsp; He cried like a
child!&nbsp; And then our bore begins his description in
detail&mdash;for all this is introductory&mdash;and strangles his
hearers with the folds of the purple drapery.</p>
<p>By an equally fortunate conjunction of accidental
circumstances, it happened that when our bore was in Switzerland,
he discovered a Valley, of that superb character, that Chamouni
is not to be mentioned in the same breath with it.&nbsp; This is
how it was, sir.&nbsp; He was travelling on a mule&mdash;had been
in the saddle some days&mdash;when, as he and the guide, Pierre
Blanquo: whom you may know, perhaps?&mdash;our bore is sorry you
don&rsquo;t, because he&rsquo;s the only guide deserving of the
name&mdash;as he and Pierre were descending, towards evening,
among those everlasting snows, to the little village of La Croix,
our bore observed a mountain track turning off sharply to the
right.&nbsp; At first he was uncertain whether it <i>was</i> a
track at all, and in fact, he said to Pierre,
&lsquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est que c&rsquo;est donc</i>, <i>mon
ami</i>?&mdash;What is that, my friend?&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>O&ugrave;</i>, <i>monsieur</i>?&rsquo; said
Pierre&mdash;&lsquo;Where, sir?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>L&agrave;</i>!&mdash;there!&rsquo; said our bore.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Monsieur</i>, <i>ce n&rsquo;est rien de
tout</i>&mdash;sir, it&rsquo;s nothing at all,&rsquo; said
Pierre.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Allons</i>!&mdash;Make haste.&nbsp; <i>Il
va neiget</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to snow!&rsquo;&nbsp; But,
our bore was not to be done in that way, and he firmly replied,
&lsquo;I wish to go in that direction&mdash;<i>je veux y
aller</i>.&nbsp; I am bent upon it&mdash;<i>je suis
d&eacute;termin&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; <i>En avant</i>!&mdash;go
ahead!&rsquo;&nbsp; In consequence of which firmness on our
bore&rsquo;s part, they proceeded, sir, during two hours of
evening, and three of moonlight (they waited in a cavern till the
moon was up), along the slenderest track, overhanging
perpendicularly the most awful gulfs, until they arrived, by a
winding descent, in a valley that possibly, and he may say
probably, was never visited by any stranger before.&nbsp; What a
valley!&nbsp; Mountains piled on mountains, avalanches stemmed by
pine forests; waterfalls, chalets, mountain-torrents, wooden
bridges, every conceivable picture of Swiss scenery!&nbsp; The
whole village turned out to receive our bore.&nbsp; The peasant
girls kissed him, the men shook hands with him, one old lady of
benevolent appearance wept upon his breast.&nbsp; He was
conducted, in a primitive triumph, to the little inn: where he
was taken ill next morning, and lay for six weeks, attended by
the amiable hostess (the same benevolent old lady who had wept
over night) and her charming daughter, Fanchette.&nbsp; It is
nothing to say that they were attentive to him; they doted on
him.&nbsp; They called him in their simple way, <i>l&rsquo;Ange
Anglais</i>&mdash;the English Angel.&nbsp; When our bore left the
valley, there was not a dry eye in the place; some of the people
attended him for miles.&nbsp; He begs and entreats of you as a
personal favour, that if you ever go to Switzerland again (you
have mentioned that your last visit was your twenty-third), you
will go to that valley, and see Swiss scenery for the first
time.&nbsp; And if you want really to know the pastoral people of
Switzerland, and to understand them, mention, in that valley, our
bore&rsquo;s name!</p>
<p>Our bore has a crushing brother in the East, who, somehow or
other, was admitted to smoke pipes with Mehemet Ali, and
instantly became an authority on the whole range of Eastern
matters, from Haroun Alraschid to the present Sultan.&nbsp; He is
in the habit of expressing mysterious opinions on this wide range
of subjects, but on questions of foreign policy more
particularly, to our bore, in letters; and our bore is
continually sending bits of these letters to the newspapers
(which they never insert), and carrying other bits about in his
pocket-book.&nbsp; It is even whispered that he has been seen at
the Foreign Office, receiving great consideration from the
messengers, and having his card promptly borne into the sanctuary
of the temple.&nbsp; The havoc committed in society by this
Eastern brother is beyond belief.&nbsp; Our bore is always ready
with him.&nbsp; We have known our bore to fall upon an
intelligent young sojourner in the wilderness, in the first
sentence of a narrative, and beat all confidence out of him with
one blow of his brother.&nbsp; He became omniscient, as to
foreign policy, in the smoking of those pipes with Mehemet
Ali.&nbsp; The balance of power in Europe, the machinations of
the Jesuits, the gentle and humanising influence of Austria, the
position and prospects of that hero of the noble soul who is
worshipped by happy France, are all easy reading to our
bore&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; And our bore is so provokingly
self-denying about him!&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to
more than a very general knowledge of these subjects
myself,&rsquo; says he, after enervating the intellects of
several strong men, &lsquo;but these are my brother&rsquo;s
opinions, and I believe he is known to be
well-informed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The commonest incidents and places would appear to have been
made special, expressly for our bore.&nbsp; Ask him whether he
ever chanced to walk, between seven and eight in the morning,
down St. James&rsquo;s Street, London, and he will tell you,
never in his life but once.&nbsp; But, it&rsquo;s curious that
that once was in eighteen thirty; and that as our bore was
walking down the street you have just mentioned, at the hour you
have just mentioned&mdash;half-past seven&mdash;or twenty minutes
to eight.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Let him be correct!&mdash;exactly a
quarter before eight by the palace clock&mdash;he met a
fresh-coloured, grey-haired, good-humoured looking gentleman,
with a brown umbrella, who, as he passed him, touched his hat and
said, &lsquo;Fine morning, sir, fine
morning!&rsquo;&mdash;William the Fourth!</p>
<p>Ask our bore whether he has seen Mr. Barry&rsquo;s new Houses
of Parliament, and he will reply that he has not yet inspected
them minutely, but, that you remind him that it was his singular
fortune to be the last man to see the old Houses of Parliament
before the fire broke out.&nbsp; It happened in this way.&nbsp;
Poor John Spine, the celebrated novelist, had taken him over to
South Lambeth to read to him the last few chapters of what was
certainly his best book&mdash;as our bore told him at the time,
adding, &lsquo;Now, my dear John, touch it, and you&rsquo;ll
spoil it!&rsquo;&mdash;and our bore was going back to the club by
way of Millbank and Parliament Street, when he stopped to think
of Canning, and look at the Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; Now, you
know far more of the philosophy of Mind than our bore does, and
are much better able to explain to him than he is to explain to
you why or wherefore, at that particular time, the thought of
fire should come into his head.&nbsp; But, it did.&nbsp; It
did.&nbsp; He thought, What a national calamity if an edifice
connected with so many associations should be consumed by
fire!&nbsp; At that time there was not a single soul in the
street but himself.&nbsp; All was quiet, dark, and
solitary.&nbsp; After contemplating the building for a
minute&mdash;or, say a minute and a half, not more&mdash;our bore
proceeded on his way, mechanically repeating, What a national
calamity if such an edifice, connected with such associations,
should be destroyed by&mdash;A man coming towards him in a
violent state of agitation completed the sentence, with the
exclamation, Fire!&nbsp; Our bore looked round, and the whole
structure was in a blaze.</p>
<p>In harmony and union with these experiences, our bore never
went anywhere in a steamboat but he made either the best or the
worst voyage ever known on that station.&nbsp; Either he
overheard the captain say to himself, with his hands clasped,
&lsquo;We are all lost!&rsquo; or the captain openly declared to
him that he had never made such a run before, and never should be
able to do it again.&nbsp; Our bore was in that express train on
that railway, when they made (unknown to the passengers) the
experiment of going at the rate of a hundred to miles an
hour.&nbsp; Our bore remarked on that occasion to the other
people in the carriage, &lsquo;This is too fast, but sit
still!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was at the Norwich musical festival when
the extraordinary echo for which science has been wholly unable
to account, was heard for the first and last time.&nbsp; He and
the bishop heard it at the same moment, and caught each
other&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; He was present at that illumination of
St. Peter&rsquo;s, of which the Pope is known to have remarked,
as he looked at it out of his window in the Vatican, &lsquo;<i>O
Cielo</i>!&nbsp; <i>Questa cosa non sara fatta</i>, <i>mai
ancora</i>, <i>come questa</i>&mdash;O Heaven! this thing will
never be done again, like this!&rsquo;&nbsp; He has seen every
lion he ever saw, under some remarkably propitious
circumstances.&nbsp; He knows there is no fancy in it, because in
every case the showman mentioned the fact at the time, and
congratulated him upon it.</p>
<p>At one period of his life, our bore had an illness.&nbsp; It
was an illness of a dangerous character for society at
large.&nbsp; Innocently remark that you are very well, or that
somebody else is very well; and our bore, with a preface that one
never knows what a blessing health is until one has lost it, is
reminded of that illness, and drags you through the whole of its
symptoms, progress, and treatment.&nbsp; Innocently remark that
you are not well, or that somebody else is not well, and the same
inevitable result ensues.&nbsp; You will learn how our bore felt
a tightness about here, sir, for which he couldn&rsquo;t account,
accompanied with a constant sensation as if he were being
stabbed&mdash;or, rather, jobbed&mdash;that expresses it more
correctly&mdash;jobbed&mdash;with a blunt knife.&nbsp; Well,
sir!&nbsp; This went on, until sparks began to flit before his
eyes, water-wheels to turn round in his head, and hammers to beat
incessantly, thump, thump, thump, all down his back&mdash;along
the whole of the spinal vertebr&aelig;.&nbsp; Our bore, when his
sensations had come to this, thought it a duty he owed to himself
to take advice, and he said, Now, whom shall I consult?&nbsp; He
naturally thought of Callow, at that time one of the most eminent
physicians in London, and he went to Callow.&nbsp; Callow said,
&lsquo;Liver!&rsquo; and prescribed rhubarb and calomel, low
diet, and moderate exercise.&nbsp; Our bore went on with this
treatment, getting worse every day, until he lost confidence in
Callow, and went to Moon, whom half the town was then mad
about.&nbsp; Moon was interested in the case; to do him justice
he was very much interested in the case; and he said,
&lsquo;Kidneys!&rsquo;&nbsp; He altered the whole treatment,
sir&mdash;gave strong acids, cupped, and blistered.&nbsp; This
went on, our bore still getting worse every day, until he openly
told Moon it would be a satisfaction to him if he would have a
consultation with Clatter.&nbsp; The moment Clatter saw our bore,
he said, &lsquo;Accumulation of fat about the heart!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Snugglewood, who was called in with him, differed, and said,
&lsquo;Brain!&rsquo;&nbsp; But, what they all agreed upon was, to
lay our bore upon his back, to shave his head, to leech him, to
administer enormous quantities of medicine, and to keep him low;
so that he was reduced to a mere shadow, you wouldn&rsquo;t have
known him, and nobody considered it possible that he could ever
recover.&nbsp; This was his condition, sir, when he heard of
Jilkins&mdash;at that period in a very small practice, and living
in the upper part of a house in Great Portland Street; but still,
you understand, with a rising reputation among the few people to
whom he was known.&nbsp; Being in that condition in which a
drowning man catches at a straw, our bore sent for Jilkins.&nbsp;
Jilkins came.&nbsp; Our bore liked his eye, and said, &lsquo;Mr.
Jilkins, I have a presentiment that you will do me
good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jilkins&rsquo;s reply was characteristic of
the man.&nbsp; It was, &lsquo;Sir, I mean to do you
good.&rsquo;&nbsp; This confirmed our bore&rsquo;s opinion of his
eye, and they went into the case together&mdash;went completely
into it.&nbsp; Jilkins then got up, walked across the room, came
back, and sat down.&nbsp; His words were these.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have been humbugged.&nbsp; This is a case of indigestion,
occasioned by deficiency of power in the Stomach.&nbsp; Take a
mutton chop in half-an-hour, with a glass of the finest old
sherry that can be got for money.&nbsp; Take two mutton chops
to-morrow, and two glasses of the finest old sherry.&nbsp; Next
day, I&rsquo;ll come again.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a week our bore was
on his legs, and Jilkins&rsquo;s success dates from that
period!</p>
<p>Our bore is great in secret information.&nbsp; He happens to
know many things that nobody else knows.&nbsp; He can generally
tell you where the split is in the Ministry; he knows a great
deal about the Queen; and has little anecdotes to relate of the
royal nursery.&nbsp; He gives you the judge&rsquo;s private
opinion of Sludge the murderer, and his thoughts when he tried
him.&nbsp; He happens to know what such a man got by such a
transaction, and it was fifteen thousand five hundred pounds, and
his income is twelve thousand a year.&nbsp; Our bore is also
great in mystery.&nbsp; He believes, with an exasperating
appearance of profound meaning, that you saw Parkins last
Sunday?&mdash;Yes, you did.&mdash;Did he say anything
particular?&mdash;No, nothing particular.&mdash;Our bore is
surprised at that.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Nothing.&nbsp; Only he
understood that Parkins had come to tell you
something.&mdash;What about?&mdash;Well! our bore is not at
liberty to mention what about.&nbsp; But, he believes you will
hear that from Parkins himself, soon, and he hopes it may not
surprise you as it did him.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, you never
heard about Parkins&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s
sister?&mdash;No.&mdash;Ah! says our bore, that explains it!</p>
<p>Our bore is also great in argument.&nbsp; He infinitely enjoys
a long humdrum, drowsy interchange of words of dispute about
nothing.&nbsp; He considers that it strengthens the mind,
consequently, he &lsquo;don&rsquo;t see that,&rsquo; very
often.&nbsp; Or, he would be glad to know what you mean by
that.&nbsp; Or, he doubts that.&nbsp; Or, he has always
understood exactly the reverse of that.&nbsp; Or, he can&rsquo;t
admit that.&nbsp; Or, he begs to deny that.&nbsp; Or, surely you
don&rsquo;t mean that.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; He once advised us;
offered us a piece of advice, after the fact, totally
impracticable and wholly impossible of acceptance, because it
supposed the fact, then eternally disposed of, to be yet in
abeyance.&nbsp; It was a dozen years ago, and to this hour our
bore benevolently wishes, in a mild voice, on certain regular
occasions, that we had thought better of his opinion.</p>
<p>The instinct with which our bore finds out another bore, and
closes with him, is amazing.&nbsp; We have seen him pick his man
out of fifty men, in a couple of minutes.&nbsp; They love to go
(which they do naturally) into a slow argument on a previously
exhausted subject, and to contradict each other, and to wear the
hearers out, without impairing their own perennial freshness as
bores.&nbsp; It improves the good understanding between them, and
they get together afterwards, and bore each other amicably.&nbsp;
Whenever we see our bore behind a door with another bore, we know
that when he comes forth, he will praise the other bore as one of
the most intelligent men he ever met.&nbsp; And this bringing us
to the close of what we had to say about our bore, we are anxious
to have it understood that he never bestowed this praise on
us.</p>
<h2><a name="page494"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 494</span>A
MONUMENT OF FRENCH FOLLY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was profoundly observed by a
witty member of the Court of Common Council, in Council assembled
in the City of London, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and fifty, that the French are a frog-eating people, who
wear wooden shoes.</p>
<p>We are credibly informed, in reference to the nation whom this
choice spirit so happily disposed of, that the caricatures and
stage representations which were current in England some half a
century ago, exactly depict their present condition.&nbsp; For
example, we understand that every Frenchman, without exception,
wears a pigtail and curl-papers.&nbsp; That he is extremely
sallow, thin, long-faced, and lantern-jawed.&nbsp; That the
calves of his legs are invariably undeveloped; that his legs fail
at the knees, and that his shoulders are always higher than his
ears.&nbsp; We are likewise assured that he rarely tastes any
food but soup maigre, and an onion; that he always says,
&lsquo;By Gar! Aha! Vat you tell me, sare?&rsquo; at the end of
every sentence he utters; and that the true generic name of his
race is the Mounseers, or the Parly-voos.&nbsp; If he be not a
dancing-master, or a barber, he must be a cook; since no other
trades but those three are congenial to the tastes of the people,
or permitted by the Institutions of the country.&nbsp; He is a
slave, of course.&nbsp; The ladies of France (who are also
slaves) invariably have their heads tied up in Belcher
handkerchiefs, wear long earrings, carry tambourines, and beguile
the weariness of their yoke by singing in head voices through
their noses&mdash;principally to barrel-organs.</p>
<p>It may be generally summed up, of this inferior people, that
they have no idea of anything.</p>
<p>Of a great Institution like Smithfield, they are unable to
form the least conception.&nbsp; A Beast Market in the heart of
Paris would be regarded an impossible nuisance.&nbsp; Nor have
they any notion of slaughter-houses in the midst of a city.&nbsp;
One of these benighted frog-eaters would scarcely understand your
meaning, if you told him of the existence of such a British
bulwark.</p>
<p>It is agreeable, and perhaps pardonable, to indulge in a
little self-complacency when our right to it is thoroughly
established.&nbsp; At the present time, to be rendered memorable
by a final attack on that good old market which is the (rotten)
apple of the Corporation&rsquo;s eye, let us compare ourselves,
to our national delight and pride as to these two subjects of
slaughter-house and beast-market, with the outlandish
foreigner.</p>
<p>The blessings of Smithfield are too well understood to need
recapitulation; all who run (away from mad bulls and pursuing
oxen) may read.&nbsp; Any market-day they may be beheld in
glorious action.&nbsp; Possibly the merits of our
slaughter-houses are not yet quite so generally appreciated.</p>
<p>Slaughter-houses, in the large towns of England, are always
(with the exception of one or two enterprising towns) most
numerous in the most densely crowded places, where there is the
least circulation of air.&nbsp; They are often underground, in
cellars; they are sometimes in close back yards; sometimes (as in
Spitalfields) in the very shops where the meat is sold.&nbsp;
Occasionally, under good private management, they are ventilated
and clean.&nbsp; For the most part, they are unventilated and
dirty; and, to the reeking walls, putrid fat and other offensive
animal matter clings with a tenacious hold.&nbsp; The busiest
slaughter-houses in London are in the neighbourhood of
Smithfield, in Newgate Market, in Whitechapel, in Newport Market,
in Leadenhall Market, in Clare Market.&nbsp; All these places are
surrounded by houses of a poor description, swarming with
inhabitants.&nbsp; Some of them are close to the worst
burial-grounds in London.&nbsp; When the slaughter-house is below
the ground, it is a common practice to throw the sheep down
areas, neck and crop&mdash;which is exciting, but not at all
cruel.&nbsp; When it is on the level surface, it is often
extremely difficult of approach.&nbsp; Then, the beasts have to
be worried, and goaded, and pronged, and tail-twisted, for a long
time before they can be got in&mdash;which is entirely owing to
their natural obstinacy.&nbsp; When it is not difficult of
approach, but is in a foul condition, what they see and scent
makes them still more reluctant to enter&mdash;which is their
natural obstinacy again.&nbsp; When they do get in at last, after
no trouble and suffering to speak of (for, there is nothing in
the previous journey into the heart of London, the night&rsquo;s
endurance in Smithfield, the struggle out again, among the
crowded multitude, the coaches, carts, waggons, omnibuses, gigs,
chaises, phaetons, cabs, trucks, dogs, boys, whoopings, roarings,
and ten thousand other distractions), they are represented to be
in a most unfit state to be killed, according to microscopic
examinations made of their fevered blood by one of the most
distinguished physiologists in the world, <span
class="smcap">Professor Owen</span>&mdash;but that&rsquo;s
humbug.&nbsp; When they <i>are</i> killed, at last, their reeking
carcases are hung in impure air, to become, as the same Professor
will explain to you, less nutritious and more
unwholesome&mdash;but he is only an <i>un</i>common counsellor,
so don&rsquo;t mind <i>him</i>.&nbsp; In half a quarter of a
mile&rsquo;s length of Whitechapel, at one time, there shall be
six hundred newly slaughtered oxen hanging up, and seven hundred
sheep&mdash;but, the more the merrier&mdash;proof of
prosperity.&nbsp; Hard by Snow Hill and Warwick Lane, you shall
see the little children, inured to sights of brutality from their
birth, trotting along the alleys, mingled with troops of horribly
busy pigs, up to their ankles in blood&mdash;but it makes the
young rascals hardy.&nbsp; Into the imperfect sewers of this
overgrown city, you shall have the immense mass of corruption,
engendered by these practices, lazily thrown out of sight, to
rise, in poisonous gases, into your house at night, when your
sleeping children will most readily absorb them, and to find its
languid way, at last, into the river that you drink&mdash;but,
the French are a frog-eating people who wear wooden shoes, and
it&rsquo;s O the roast beef of England, my boy, the jolly old
English roast beef.</p>
<p>It is quite a mistake&mdash;a newfangled notion
altogether&mdash;to suppose that there is any natural antagonism
between putrefaction and health.&nbsp; They know better than
that, in the Common Council.&nbsp; You may talk about Nature, in
her wisdom, always warning man through his sense of smell, when
he draws near to something dangerous; but, that won&rsquo;t go
down in the City.&nbsp; Nature very often don&rsquo;t mean
anything.&nbsp; Mrs. Quickly says that prunes are ill for a green
wound; but whosoever says that putrid animal substances are ill
for a green wound, or for robust vigour, or for anything or for
anybody, is a humanity-monger and a humbug.&nbsp; Britons never,
never, never, &amp;c., therefore.&nbsp; And prosperity to
cattle-driving, cattle-slaughtering, bone-crushing,
blood-boiling, trotter-scraping, tripe-dressing, paunch-cleaning,
gut-spinning, hide-preparing, tallow-melting, and other
salubrious proceedings, in the midst of hospitals, churchyards,
workhouses, schools, infirmaries, refuges, dwellings,
provision-shops nurseries, sick-beds, every stage and
baiting-place in the journey from birth to death!</p>
<p>These <i>un</i>common counsellors, your Professor Owens and
fellows, will contend that to tolerate these things in a
civilised city, is to reduce it to a worse condition than <span
class="smcap">Bruce</span> found to prevail in <span
class="smcap">Abyssinia</span>.&nbsp; For there (say they) the
jackals and wild dogs came at night to devour the offal; whereas,
here there are no such natural scavengers, and quite as savage
customs.&nbsp; Further, they will demonstrate that nothing in
Nature is intended to be wasted, and that besides the waste which
such abuses occasion in the articles of health and
life&mdash;main sources of the riches of any community&mdash;they
lead to a prodigious waste of changing matters, which might, with
proper preparation, and under scientific direction, be safely
applied to the increase of the fertility of the land.&nbsp; Thus
(they argue) does Nature ever avenge infractions of her
beneficent laws, and so surely as Man is determined to warp any
of her blessings into curses, shall they become curses, and shall
he suffer heavily.&nbsp; But, this is cant.&nbsp; Just as it is
cant of the worst description to say to the London Corporation,
&lsquo;How can you exhibit to the people so plain a spectacle of
dishonest equivocation, as to claim the right of holding a market
in the midst of the great city, for one of your vested
privileges, when you know that when your last market holding
charter was granted to you by King Charles the First, Smithfield
stood <span class="smcap">in the Suburbs of London</span>, and is
in that very charter so described in those five
words?&rsquo;&mdash;which is certainly true, but has nothing to
do with the question.</p>
<p>Now to the comparison, in these particulars of civilisation,
between the capital of England, and the capital of that
frog-eating and wooden-shoe wearing country, which the
illustrious Common Councilman so sarcastically settled.</p>
<p>In Paris, there is no Cattle Market.&nbsp; Cows and calves are
sold within the city, but, the Cattle Markets are at Poissy,
about thirteen miles off, on a line of railway; and at Sceaux,
about five miles off.&nbsp; The Poissy market is held every
Thursday; the Sceaux market, every Monday.&nbsp; In Paris, there
are no slaughter-houses, in our acceptation of the term.&nbsp;
There are five public Abattoirs&mdash;within the walls, though in
the suburbs&mdash;and in these all the slaughtering for the city
must be performed.&nbsp; They are managed by a Syndicat or Guild
of Butchers, who confer with the Minister of the Interior on all
matters affecting the trade, and who are consulted when any new
regulations are contemplated for its government.&nbsp; They are,
likewise, under the vigilant superintendence of the police.&nbsp;
Every butcher must be licensed: which proves him at once to be a
slave, for we don&rsquo;t license butchers in England&mdash;we
only license apothecaries, attorneys, post-masters, publicans,
hawkers, retailers of tobacco, snuff, pepper, and
vinegar&mdash;and one or two other little trades, not worth
mentioning.&nbsp; Every arrangement in connexion with the
slaughtering and sale of meat, is matter of strict police
regulation.&nbsp; (Slavery again, though we certainly have a
general sort of Police Act here.)</p>
<p>But, in order that the reader may understand what a monument
of folly these frog-eaters have raised in their abattoirs and
cattle-markets, and may compare it with what common counselling
has done for us all these years, and would still do but for the
innovating spirit of the times, here follows a short account of a
recent visit to these places:</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was as sharp a February morning as you would desire to feel
at your fingers&rsquo; ends when I turned out&mdash;tumbling over
a chiffonier with his little basket and rake, who was picking up
the bits of coloured paper that had been swept out, over-night,
from a Bon-Bon shop&mdash;to take the Butchers&rsquo; Train to
Poissy.&nbsp; A cold, dim light just touched the high roofs of
the Tuileries which have seen such changes, such distracted
crowds, such riot and bloodshed; and they looked as calm, and as
old, all covered with white frost, as the very Pyramids.&nbsp;
There was not light enough, yet, to strike upon the towers of
Notre Dame across the water; but I thought of the dark pavement
of the old Cathedral as just beginning to be streaked with grey;
and of the lamps in the &lsquo;House of God,&rsquo; the Hospital
close to it, burning low and being quenched; and of the keeper of
the Morgue going about with a fading lantern, busy in the
arrangement of his terrible waxwork for another sunny day.</p>
<p>The sun was up, and shining merrily when the butchers and I,
announcing our departure with an engine shriek to sleepy Paris,
rattled away for the Cattle Market.&nbsp; Across the country,
over the Seine, among a forest of scrubby trees&mdash;the hoar
frost lying cold in shady places, and glittering in the
light&mdash;and here we are&mdash;at Poissy!&nbsp; Out leap the
butchers, who have been chattering all the way like madmen, and
off they straggle for the Cattle Market (still chattering, of
course, incessantly), in hats and caps of all shapes, in coats
and blouses, in calf-skins, cow-skins, horse-skins, furs, shaggy
mantles, hairy coats, sacking, baize, oil-skin, anything you
please that will keep a man and a butcher warm, upon a frosty
morning.</p>
<p>Many a French town have I seen, between this spot of ground
and Strasburg or Marseilles, that might sit for your picture,
little Poissy!&nbsp; Barring the details of your old church, I
know you well, albeit we make acquaintance, now, for the first
time.&nbsp; I know your narrow, straggling, winding streets, with
a kennel in the midst, and lamps slung across.&nbsp; I know your
picturesque street-corners, winding up-hill Heaven knows why or
where!&nbsp; I know your tradesmen&rsquo;s inscriptions, in
letters not quite fat enough; your barbers&rsquo; brazen basins
dangling over little shops; your Caf&eacute;s and Estaminets,
with cloudy bottles of stale syrup in the windows, and pictures
of crossed billiard cues outside.&nbsp; I know this identical
grey horse with his tail rolled up in a knot like the &lsquo;back
hair&rsquo; of an untidy woman, who won&rsquo;t be shod, and who
makes himself heraldic by clattering across the street on his
hind-legs, while twenty voices shriek and growl at him as a
Brigand, an accursed Robber, and an everlastingly-doomed
Pig.&nbsp; I know your sparkling town-fountain, too, my Poissy,
and am glad to see it near a cattle-market, gushing so freshly,
under the auspices of a gallant little sublimated Frenchman
wrought in metal, perched upon the top.&nbsp; Through all the
land of France I know this unswept room at The Glory, with its
peculiar smell of beans and coffee, where the butchers crowd
about the stove, drinking the thinnest of wine from the smallest
of tumblers; where the thickest of coffee-cups mingle with the
longest of loaves, and the weakest of lump sugar; where Madame at
the counter easily acknowledges the homage of all entering and
departing butchers; where the billiard-table is covered up in the
midst like a great bird-cake&mdash;but the bird may sing
by-and-by!</p>
<p>A bell!&nbsp; The Calf Market!&nbsp; Polite departure of
butchers.&nbsp; Hasty payment and departure on the part of
amateur Visitor.&nbsp; Madame reproaches Ma&rsquo;amselle for too
fine a susceptibility in reference to the devotion of a Butcher
in a bear-skin.&nbsp; Monsieur, the landlord of The Glory, counts
a double handful of sous, without an unobliterated inscription,
or an undamaged crowned head, among them.</p>
<p>There is little noise without, abundant space, and no
confusion.&nbsp; The open area devoted to the market is divided
into three portions: the Calf Market, the Cattle Market, the
Sheep Market.&nbsp; Calves at eight, cattle at ten, sheep at
mid-day.&nbsp; All is very clean.</p>
<p>The Calf Market is a raised platform of stone, some three or
four feet high, open on all sides, with a lofty overspreading
roof, supported on stone columns, which give it the appearance of
a sort of vineyard from Northern Italy.&nbsp; Here, on the raised
pavement, lie innumerable calves, all bound hind-legs and
fore-legs together, and all trembling violently&mdash;perhaps
with cold, perhaps with fear, perhaps with pain; for, this mode
of tying, which seems to be an absolute superstition with the
peasantry, can hardly fail to cause great suffering.&nbsp; Here,
they lie, patiently in rows, among the straw, with their stolid
faces and inexpressive eyes, superintended by men and women, boys
and girls; here they are inspected by our friends, the butchers,
bargained for, and bought.&nbsp; Plenty of time; plenty of room;
plenty of good humour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Monsieur Francois in the
bear-skin, how do you do, my friend?&nbsp; You come from Paris by
the train?&nbsp; The fresh air does you good.&nbsp; If you are in
want of three or four fine calves this market morning, my angel,
I, Madame Doche, shall be happy to deal with you.&nbsp; Behold
these calves, Monsieur Francois!&nbsp; Great Heaven, you are
doubtful!&nbsp; Well, sir, walk round and look about you.&nbsp;
If you find better for the money, buy them.&nbsp; If not, come to
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Monsieur Francois goes his way leisurely, and
keeps a wary eye upon the stock.&nbsp; No other butcher jostles
Monsieur Francois; Monsieur Francois jostles no other
butcher.&nbsp; Nobody is flustered and aggravated.&nbsp; Nobody
is savage.&nbsp; In the midst of the country blue frocks and red
handkerchiefs, and the butchers&rsquo; coats, shaggy, furry, and
hairy: of calf-skin, cow-skin, horse-skin, and bear-skin: towers
a cocked hat and a blue cloak.&nbsp; Slavery!&nbsp; For
<i>our</i> Police wear great-coats and glazed hats.</p>
<p>But now the bartering is over, and the calves are sold.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ho! Gregoire, Antoine, Jean, Louis!&nbsp; Bring up the
carts, my children! Quick, brave infants!&nbsp; Hola!&nbsp;
Hi!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The carts, well littered with straw, are backed up to the edge
of the raised pavement, and various hot infants carry calves upon
their heads, and dexterously pitch them in, while other hot
infants, standing in the carts, arrange the calves, and pack them
carefully in straw.&nbsp; Here is a promising young calf, not
sold, whom Madame Doche unbinds.&nbsp; Pardon me, Madame Doche,
but I fear this mode of tying the four legs of a quadruped
together, though strictly &agrave; la mode, is not quite
right.&nbsp; You observe, Madame Doche, that the cord leaves deep
indentations in the skin, and that the animal is so cramped at
first as not to know, or even remotely suspect that he <i>is</i>
unbound, until you are so obliging as to kick him, in your
delicate little way, and pull his tail like a bell-rope.&nbsp;
Then, he staggers to his knees, not being able to stand, and
stumbles about like a drunken calf, or the horse at
Franconi&rsquo;s, whom you may have seen, Madame Doche, who is
supposed to have been mortally wounded in battle.&nbsp; But, what
is this rubbing against me, as I apostrophise Madame Doche?&nbsp;
It is another heated infant with a calf upon his head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pardon, Monsieur, but will you have the politeness to
allow me to pass?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, sir, willingly.&nbsp; I
am vexed to obstruct the way.&rsquo;&nbsp; On he staggers, calf
and all, and makes no allusion whatever either to my eyes or
limbs.</p>
<p>Now, the carts are all full.&nbsp; More straw, my Antoine, to
shake over these top rows; then, off we will clatter, rumble,
jolt, and rattle, a long row of us, out of the first town-gate,
and out at the second town-gate, and past the empty sentry-box,
and the little thin square bandbox of a guardhouse, where nobody
seems to live: and away for Paris, by the paved road, lying, a
straight, straight line, in the long, long avenue of trees.&nbsp;
We can neither choose our road, nor our pace, for that is all
prescribed to us.&nbsp; The public convenience demands that our
carts should get to Paris by such a route, and no other (Napoleon
had leisure to find that out, while he had a little war with the
world upon his hands), and woe betide us if we infringe
orders.</p>
<p>Drovers of oxen stand in the Cattle Market, tied to iron bars
fixed into posts of granite.&nbsp; Other droves advance slowly
down the long avenue, past the second town-gate, and the first
town-gate, and the sentry-box, and the bandbox, thawing the
morning with their smoky breath as they come along.&nbsp; Plenty
of room; plenty of time.&nbsp; Neither man nor beast is driven
out of his wits by coaches, carts, waggons, omnibuses, gigs,
chaises, phaetons, cabs, trucks, boys, whoopings, roarings, and
multitudes.&nbsp; No tail-twisting is necessary&mdash;no iron
pronging is necessary.&nbsp; There are no iron prongs here.&nbsp;
The market for cattle is held as quietly as the market for
calves.&nbsp; In due time, off the cattle go to Paris; the
drovers can no more choose their road, nor their time, nor the
numbers they shall drive, than they can choose their hour for
dying in the course of nature.</p>
<p>Sheep next.&nbsp; The sheep-pens are up here, past the Branch
Bank of Paris established for the convenience of the butchers,
and behind the two pretty fountains they are making in the
Market.&nbsp; My name is Bull: yet I think I should like to see
as good twin fountains&mdash;not to say in Smithfield, but in
England anywhere.&nbsp; Plenty of room; plenty of time.&nbsp; And
here are sheep-dogs, sensible as ever, but with a certain French
air about them&mdash;not without a suspicion of
dominoes&mdash;with a kind of flavour of moustache and
beard&mdash;demonstrative dogs, shaggy and loose where an English
dog would be tight and close&mdash;not so troubled with business
calculations as our English drovers&rsquo; dogs, who have always
got their sheep upon their minds, and think about their work,
even resting, as you may see by their faces; but, dashing, showy,
rather unreliable dogs: who might worry me instead of their
legitimate charges if they saw occasion&mdash;and might see it
somewhat suddenly.</p>
<p>The market for sheep passes off like the other two; and away
they go, by <i>their</i> allotted road to Paris.&nbsp; My way
being the Railway, I make the best of it at twenty miles an hour;
whirling through the now high-lighted landscape; thinking that
the inexperienced green buds will be wishing, before long, they
had not been tempted to come out so soon; and wondering who lives
in this or that ch&acirc;teau, all window and lattice, and what
the family may have for breakfast this sharp morning.</p>
<p>After the Market comes the Abattoir.&nbsp; What abattoir shall
I visit first?&nbsp; Montmartre is the largest.&nbsp; So I will
go there.</p>
<p>The abattoirs are all within the walls of Paris, with an eye
to the receipt of the octroi duty; but, they stand in open places
in the suburbs, removed from the press and bustle of the
city.&nbsp; They are managed by the Syndicat or Guild of
Butchers, under the inspection of the Police.&nbsp; Certain
smaller items of the revenue derived from them are in part
retained by the Guild for the payment of their expenses, and in
part devoted by it to charitable purposes in connexion with the
trade.&nbsp; They cost six hundred and eighty thousand pounds;
and they return to the city of Paris an interest on that outlay,
amounting to nearly six and a-half per cent.</p>
<p>Here, in a sufficiently dismantled space is the Abattoir of
Montmartre, covering nearly nine acres of ground, surrounded by a
high wall, and looking from the outside like a cavalry
barrack.&nbsp; At the iron gates is a small functionary in a
large cocked hat. &lsquo;Monsieur desires to see the
abattoir?&nbsp; Most certainly.&rsquo;&nbsp; State being
inconvenient in private transactions, and Monsieur being already
aware of the cocked hat, the functionary puts it into a little
official bureau which it almost fills, and accompanies me in the
modest attire&mdash;as to his head&mdash;of ordinary life.</p>
<p>Many of the animals from Poissy have come here.&nbsp; On the
arrival of each drove, it was turned into yonder ample space,
where each butcher who had bought, selected his own
purchases.&nbsp; Some, we see now, in these long perspectives of
stalls with a high over-hanging roof of wood and open tiles
rising above the walls.&nbsp; While they rest here, before being
slaughtered, they are required to be fed and watered, and the
stalls must be kept clean.&nbsp; A stated amount of fodder must
always be ready in the loft above; and the supervision is of the
strictest kind.&nbsp; The same regulations apply to sheep and
calves; for which, portions of these perspectives are strongly
railed off.&nbsp; All the buildings are of the strongest and most
solid description.</p>
<p>After traversing these lairs, through which, besides the upper
provision for ventilation just mentioned, there may be a thorough
current of air from opposite windows in the side walls, and from
doors at either end, we traverse the broad, paved, court-yard
until we come to the slaughter-houses.&nbsp; They are all exactly
alike, and adjoin each other, to the number of eight or nine
together, in blocks of solid building.&nbsp; Let us walk into the
first.</p>
<p>It is firmly built and paved with stone.&nbsp; It is well
lighted, thoroughly aired, and lavishly provided with fresh
water.&nbsp; It has two doors opposite each other; the first, the
door by which I entered from the main yard; the second, which is
opposite, opening on another smaller yard, where the sheep and
calves are killed on benches.&nbsp; The pavement of that yard, I
see, slopes downward to a gutter, for its being more easily
cleansed.&nbsp; The slaughter-house is fifteen feet high, sixteen
feet and a-half wide, and thirty-three feet long.&nbsp; It is
fitted with a powerful windlass, by which one man at the handle
can bring the head of an ox down to the ground to receive the
blow from the pole-axe that is to fell him&mdash;with the means
of raising the carcass and keeping it suspended during the
after-operation of dressing&mdash;and with hooks on which
carcasses can hang, when completely prepared, without touching
the walls.&nbsp; Upon the pavement of this first stone chamber,
lies an ox scarcely dead.&nbsp; If I except the blood draining
from him, into a little stone well in a corner of the pavement,
the place is free from offence as the Place de la Concorde.&nbsp;
It is infinitely purer and cleaner, I know, my friend the
functionary, than the Cathedral of Notre Dame.&nbsp; Ha,
ha!&nbsp; Monsieur is pleasant, but, truly, there is reason, too,
in what he says.</p>
<p>I look into another of these slaughter-houses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pray enter,&rsquo; says a gentleman in bloody boots.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is a calf I have killed this morning.&nbsp; Having a
little time upon my hands, I have cut and punctured this lace
pattern in the coats of his stomach.&nbsp; It is pretty
enough.&nbsp; I did it to divert myself.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It
is beautiful, Monsieur, the slaughterer!&rsquo;&nbsp; He tells me
I have the gentility to say so.</p>
<p>I look into rows of slaughter-houses.&nbsp; In many, retail
dealers, who have come here for the purpose, are making bargains
for meat.&nbsp; There is killing enough, certainly, to satiate an
unused eye; and there are steaming carcasses enough, to suggest
the expediency of a fowl and salad for dinner; but, everywhere,
there is an orderly, clean, well-systematised routine of work in
progress&mdash;horrible work at the best, if you please; but, so
much the greater reason why it should be made the best of.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know (I think I have observed, my name is Bull)
that a Parisian of the lowest order is particularly delicate, or
that his nature is remarkable for an infinitesimal infusion of
ferocity; but, I do know, my potent, grave, and common
counselling Signors, that he is forced, when at this work, to
submit himself to a thoroughly good system, and to make an
Englishman very heartily ashamed of you.</p>
<p>Here, within the walls of the same abattoir, in other roomy
and commodious buildings, are a place for converting the fat into
tallow and packing it for market&mdash;a place for cleansing and
scalding calves&rsquo; heads and sheep&rsquo;s feet&mdash;a place
for preparing tripe&mdash;stables and coach-houses for the
butchers&mdash;innumerable conveniences, aiding in the diminution
of offensiveness to its lowest possible point, and the raising of
cleanliness and supervision to their highest.&nbsp; Hence, all
the meat that goes out of the gate is sent away in clean covered
carts.&nbsp; And if every trade connected with the slaughtering
of animals were obliged by law to be carried on in the same
place, I doubt, my friend, now reinstated in the cocked hat
(whose civility these two francs imperfectly acknowledge, but
appear munificently to repay), whether there could be better
regulations than those which are carried out at the Abattoir of
Montmartre.&nbsp; Adieu, my friend, for I am away to the other
side of Paris, to the Abattoir of Grenelle!&nbsp; And there I
find exactly the same thing on a smaller scale, with the addition
of a magnificent Artesian well, and a different sort of
conductor, in the person of a neat little woman with neat little
eyes, and a neat little voice, who picks her neat little way
among the bullocks in a very neat little pair of shoes and
stockings.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Such is the Monument of French Folly which a foreigneering
people have erected, in a national hatred and antipathy for
common counselling wisdom.&nbsp; That wisdom, assembled in the
City of London, having distinctly refused, after a debate of
three days long, and by a majority of nearly seven to one, to
associate itself with any Metropolitan Cattle Market unless it be
held in the midst of the City, it follows that we shall lose the
inestimable advantages of common counselling protection, and be
thrown, for a market, on our own wretched resources.&nbsp; In all
human probability we shall thus come, at last, to erect a
monument of folly very like this French monument.&nbsp; If that
be done, the consequences are obvious.&nbsp; The leather trade
will be ruined, by the introduction of American timber, to be
manufactured into shoes for the fallen English; the Lord Mayor
will be required, by the popular voice, to live entirely on
frogs; and both these changes will (how, is not at present quite
clear, but certainly somehow or other) fall on that unhappy
landed interest which is always being killed, yet is always found
to be alive&mdash;and kicking.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
